271623583,5,EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just believe me that these speakers sound what they look like. That’s all. Since they are powered, they pack a punch with a built-in little amp. That means you will hear a GOOD bass there. 
I connected a Belkin Airplay 2 receiver with the 3.5mm jack-to-RCA cable included and now it’s an intelligent speaker in my Apple HomeKit environment. My living room is small so these are more than enough! I totally recommend these to anyone. Besides, it’s only $99. Just return them if you don’t like them, which I doubt.",2021-11-13T07:38:10,Peter,Best Buy US,True
227648828,5,Great sound out of these speakers,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love these speakers. I’ve always had portable speakers with crappy sound and these are a game changer. I love the bass and how full the sound is. I played around with all types of music and they all sound great. One thing i love most is the look and size of them. The wooden outside makes them seem more modest and modern and they fit right on my tv stand without looking bulky. I also really love the controls that are on the side of the speaker. You can play around with bass and treble and make it your own. They also come with a remote which is nice. They were super easy to set up and I had no issues. One thing that could be changed is the fact that you have to connect your device through an aux cord. I would have thought that all speakers are Bluetooth now. Regardless of that I love these speakers and highly recommend!,2020-04-21T23:36:28,Hann1026,Best Buy US,True

274284460,5,"Great sounding, cheap and easy to set up.","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What an incredible sound from $100 speakers! Set up was pretty simple, just plugging in the RCA and speaker cords, then connecting to the AUX on my PC and that was it!

The remote is extremely simple with mute and volume up and down, while more controls are found on the main speaker for treble, bass and volume. The sound is clean and rich, although the bass is a little lacking, but I'm fine with that since they are desktop speakers and shaking your rig isn't the best idea.

The look is also very nice! I think I prefer the protective screen off to see the speakers themselves and the wood look is a fantastic aesthetic.

10/10 for the cost",2022-01-06T22:45:46,MrBoZiffer,Best Buy US,True
299079099,4,"Pretty decent, nice and loud.","These speakers definitely bring more than expected.  They have great, but not excellent, sound.  The bass is definitely much better than I expected, and I was buying these based from reviews and the price.  

The speakers are hefty, have decent magnets based by the weight and sound quality. Only downside is the equalizer on the side.  I can adjust the bass and treble, and is fine except when turning either to the extreme positive end, you can hear the compression of the opposite.  Meaning when turning up treble it's fine until it reaches the extreme + side, where you can hear the bass being cut rather than treble added, and the same is true for the bass.

Because this is only at the extreme ends of either, I just keep them lower in my settings and they sound fine. (Extreme being the last 1/16 of the turn approximately)

They really are good speakers, as I am using them as studio monitors and they haven't given any kind of issues.  I would recommend these to a friend, for sure.",2023-01-20T23:46:25,SUAHB,Best Buy US,True
342169417,4,Not a great pick if you can't play it loud,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Don't get this if you don't like playing sounds at a relatively high volume. At lower volume it sounds like regular cheap speakers. You have to play it at a fairly high volume to actually get a feel of the sound quality.

279835889,4,Good speakers but poor grill color choice,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The speakers are used on a TV to replace the tinny TV speakers.
The line (RCA) outputs on the TV were used which required the volume control on the speakers to be at max. The vol control on
the speakers have no stops! When the speakers are turned off, they DO NOT remember the vol setting. I just leave them on 24/7.

The wood case is nice but the color of the grill (light grey) is a miss-match. I looked online for a brown or tan grill, but all that is available is a black grill directly from Edifier.

The sound quality is much better than the TV speakers.",2022-05-14T20:41:25,Speaker,Best Buy US,False

Sound quality is great, I have been playing games, music and movies and it does the job right.

If you weren’t on a budget I would suggest you get the wireless version of this so it would be easy for you to manage the wires. But regardless of the wires they sound great no complaints.",2023-01-27T10:31:09,Jich19,Best Buy US,True

299079135,4,Great home office speakers for the price,"Great sound for the price. During the day, these are the speakers for my home office to sue for focus music and zoom calls. In the off hours, they get used for playing all types of music. The only area they struggle for me, slightly, is with directionality. If they aren’t pointed towards you, the sound quality tapers off.

258902213,5,Great little speakers for a home studio,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wanted something better than generic desktop computer speakers for my little home studio. I couldn't afford professional near-field monitors, so I settled on these. I am not disappointed! They are wonderful little speakers. More bass then I would have expected out of 4"" cones. Plenty of volume for filling the room with music from Band Camp or Sportify when I am not playing something of my own. 

The sound develops well when sitting close, a requirement for monitors. The two inputs are handy. Both are active at the same time, so you can mix two sources or go back and forth without touching the speakers (there is no fade between the inputs which would be nice, but you can't have everything for the price). I don't use the little remote, but it works if you need it. 

They include both RCA cables as well as a 3.5mm TRS cable to connect to a computer or phone (if your phone still has  headphone jack). They do have a Blue Tooth version if you need it. Both inputs are line in, so you would need a preamp to connect microphones or a turntable with low level outputs.

Best Buy does a great job with packing and shipping. I definitely recommend these if you are looking decent powered speakers in the price range.",2021-04-24T14:06:20,Farmyou,Best Buy US,True

297246207,4,Better than I initially believed.,"I'm not going to lie, I thought these things were going to be horrible toys. The wood finish and knobs on the side just reminded me of a cheap toy speaker that came with a generic PC. Yes, I saw the reviews of people saying that they were happy with their choice of these speakers. So gave it a shot because I was ready for a bigger presence on my desk than the Audioengine A2s(overpriced $250) that I had. The lack of more filling bass had reached its conclusion with those. So after failing to find any speakers that would go with my setup ( needed to find speakers that had dual RCA connections inputs)...I ran into these at best buy but couldn't test them until I got home. After I got home and first listened, I was totally underwhelmed and was ready to take them back. But then I added my stands with tilt under them and allow them a couple of hours to warm up. After that, the sound started to fill in better and tilt gave it more life. I heard more spacious and directional sounds from them over the A2s and of course more bass, finally. Now I'm sure there are better bass tones from other speakers( I would give them a 7 out of 10 for bass quality) but having the convenience of the dual connection for my DJ Deck and my PC with a remote and separate EQ was starting to grow on me big time. It was so nice not to have to go to my PC or speakers to turn up/down the sound while mixing or having to pull out RCA cables for one, then the other when I was ready to use them. Before I knew it, I was sitting at my computer desk and starting to appreciate more and more with each hour that passed.
At the end of the day, I would give this speaker set a 7.5 out of 10. There is beauty found in them for the right needs but they aren't game-changing and yes they could be better, but these are $119 and at that price, you are getting more than what you paid for. So at the end of the day, I believe that is the goal for any tech product, to give back more than what the owner paid for.",2022-12-30T20:00:33,Methos,Best Buy US,True

Corsair really hit the nail on the head with this one because it looks amazing and is very high quality. Cable management is super easy with all of the velcro straps, zip ties, cable channels, and small holes for zip ties included. My temps have also been really good with 3 front intake and 2 exhaust fans (1 back + 1 top). Running a 3700x and 3070, I never see my temps go above 65 degrees while running games at high settings. The only issues I had is that the front dust filter is a bit saggy and will rub against the fans. I personally fixed this by just hot gluing a beam across to hold it. They also should’ve made the vertical mount not as close as it is to the glass. Overall, still an amazing case and I’m surprised it’s not more popular.",2021-01-05T10:05:06,Frank,Best Buy US,True

I especially like the easy to clean dust filter behind the front grill which is where the majority of people put intake fans (have an iCUE H150i ELITE CAPELLIX Liquid CPU Cooler in front - RGB turned off of course).

My only flaw with this case, is that it doesn’t come with RGB fans. The two fans included aren’t RGB and are pre-installed in the middle of the front panel, and the rear. Why the middle is beyond me but it should include at the minimum one for each 3 locations. *Ignore the LED Boot Light.

318737319,4,Good Mid-Tower,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Needed a not-so-expensive case mid-tower case to build my 8 year old his first computer with some components I had on hand with a few new fans, etc… This case was in stock ay my local Best Buy and fit the bill perfectly for what I was using. The tinted tempered glass panel is a nice touch in my opinion. It comes with two fans already mounted, one on the front of the case and one at the rear. I am using both of them and they are fine. The two SSD mounts are nice (I am using one) and it comes with a hard drive tray for two additional storage drives. The reason for the 4 star rating over the five, is because of the hard drive tray. When you install the power supply unit, you have no room to connect the cables because of the hard drive tray. You can move the tray further to the left (which I HAD to do) so you can at least TRY to connect your PSU cables. Keep that in mind if you are using HDD’s. Cable management is nice though. This is a nice case for builds like mine and maybe a mid tier build using AIO coolers. Overall I am happy with the case and it presents really well.",2023-09-24T21:51:34,LTwinJeff,Best Buy US,True

The airflow is fantastic and I'm now getting lower temperatures under load so I don't have to worry about it overheating.

342137207,4,Beautifully crafted case with solid cooling,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely incredible case! Such a sleek, clean design, coupled with superb cooling performance make this case a must-have for anyone who's serious about their build.

The build quality is top-notch, and it's mechanically designed very well. It's easy to remove the panels, front panel included, as they just ""snap"" right into place via ball slots to hold them down. 

As for extra aesthetics, there's no included lighting in this case, which may turn some people off, but honestly I sort of prefer it this way. My last case came with two light strips and they looked pretty nice, but man this one looks so fresh without that, with just the components lighting shining beautifully through the tinted glass panel.

One thing I'd change about this case, though, is the number of USB ports. It has a USB-C port on the front, and only a single USB-A port (the standard rectangular port, for those unfamiliar with the name) Also, be warned, this USB-C port is a newer generation, and therefore uses a different connector than the standard USB connector found on most motherboards. If your board doesn't have the proper header for that plug, then you'll need to get an adapter for it in order to use that USB-C port.

Overall, this case has proven to be a great replacement for my old one, and I definitely recommend it! Knocked a star off for that USB-C port roadblock, as in my opinion, if you're going to make and sell a product that requires a still relatively uncommon header to fully function as intended, you should make sure to include the adapter, as they're pretty cheap and are necessary for a lot of users.",2024-04-20T14:50:56,ZacharyS,Best Buy US,True

250784106,5,"Good job, Corsair","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is seriously a great case. Building in it was pretty easy, the one issue I hade was getting my PSU in. I hade to unplug my USB connections and my HD Audio on my MOBO so they did not get pinched when installing the PSU. Even with no wires in the way, it still was a very tight fit so make sure you look at the dimensions of your PSU to make sure it will fit. Other than that, This case just looks beautiful with all your eye candy RGB installed. Really a case you can show off.

265188726,4,Reasonably Affordable with Solid Build Quality,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The aesthetics are clean, and the roomy interior is well thought out although the top is a little tight. Carefully measure if you're putting a radiator there to make sure it clears the motherboard VRMs.

The Chassis can hold 7 fans, but only comes with two budget Corsair fans that need to be upgraded if you're looking for airflow performance. With the right fans the case lives up to its Airflow moniker.

Both the front and the top of the case come with mesh filters to filter dust, which is a nice touch.

The only thing that is lacking aside from the fans is the front anel is rather sparse with only a single USB 3.1 type C port and a single USB 3.0 Type-A port. Overall it's at the higher end of budget or lower end of mid-range and it's solidy built. With the right components it looks very good.",2021-07-13T07:58:53,hahanson,Best Buy US,True
281423413,5,From budget to high end - this does has it all.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've now built in the 4000d airflow 3 times personally and another for a good friend.  Airflow is great, enough room to house most components as well as custom loop cooling solutions.  While it only comes with two 3pin case fans, its a great case for starters or budget builds.  Plenty of cpu cooling space for large air coolers or 360/280 rads.  At its price point, especially while on sale, its a great bang for buck case. 

It provides great airflow, doesn't have a huge footprint, and looks like an absolute unit of a case cosmetically.

I added in Noctua fans and it quickly became a wind tunnel, keeping my 5900x/6950xt cool with tons of airflow.  You don't need an overly expensive case for performance.  The 4000d is my go to, and I often recommend it to friends or people online looking for a banger.",2022-06-20T15:47:23,LinuxGamer,Best Buy US,True

Being that I am used the Corsair ecosystem and that this case is actually very well reviewed due to its easy of build, and solid ventilation, I opted to pick this guy up. Build went as easy as making toast. I did wish it supported 360 up top while maintaining its current size. Plenty of space in the back for wire management and storing goodies.",2023-12-09T19:27:14,brazilianloser,Best Buy US,True
270899518,5,In love with this case!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This case made it so easy for me, a beginner, to build my pc! It honestly came with more of a helping hand than I would have thought. I’m in love with my setup and the size is just perfect enough for each part without taking up too much space on my desk. The side panel is so perfect since it has a slight tint, helps hide any wire imperfections at the bottom, that way I can highlight the RBG parts!

My only complaint is that there’s not as much space for the Corsair led/fan box in the back. I wish it were smaller or came attached already. I managed to stick in on in the back (comes with sticking tape) but if I want to remove the cables, I’ll have to remove and reattach it. Otherwise, the cable management is looking really great for a beginner like me. Lots of space in the bottom to place some wires. It also came with Velcro ties and zip ties, amazing!",2021-10-25T22:14:37,Nikki,Best Buy US,True

I only bought a new case because old case would fit my new behemoth video card. 

I replaced front three fans and rear fan with ARGB ones. I love the new bling they bring.

I also like how the cables go ""behind the scenes"" in back of case behind the motherboard. Very clean looking.

Has great airflow, great build quality, and it really easy to build in. I swapped from an NZXT 500 to this, and while they are about the same size (4000D is a little wider), I found building in the 4000D a little easier. The great airflow means I can run my fans at lower speed too, which is great. It can also fit a 280mm and a 240mm AIO at the same time, which is the main reason I bought it. Have a picture below shoing that its possible (ignore ugly cable and cables, GPU pump cable was temporary, and rest of cables will be replaced with custom sleeved ones).",2021-12-31T17:40:43,wmason,Best Buy US,True

The glass panel is tinted giving it a unique look. Just wanted to throw that out there in case you wanted more lighting inside you might have to add some led strips. All in all this is a good value for any type of build. Budget, mid-range, or high end. For $90 right now I'd say it's a dang good deal!",2023-08-03T22:43:25,Jason,Best Buy US,True

1155707089,4,New Asus GR701 build,"This review entails my first PC build ever, and as a senior citizen I was somewhat concerned with my technical abilities, though I have owned many PCs over the years.  I purchased the following Asus ROG brand parts: GR701 Hyperion Case, Thor 1200w P2 PSU, Ryujin III 360 AIO, Strix Z790-E WiFi II MB, STRIX RTX4080S GPU.  The build was fairly straight forward with the case providing ample room for everything, the case is huge.  The included Fan/ARGB hub simplified the connections of all the fan and lighted components.  It looks amazing with all the Aura RGB lights.  This PC build worked as flawlessly as I had hoped given all the Asus components working together perfectly.  I liked the Armory Crate ability to update all my drivers for all these components with one simple effort.  I only have two critical comments in an otherwise beautiful and fantastic build.  1) The screws holding the PCI slot covers are very difficult to reach, this made the installation of the GPU more difficult than necessary, though the built-in support bracket is wonderful.  2) The case has two type c ports on the front but the motherboard only supports one.  I updated the bios, loaded Win 11, and everything worked perfectly, I really couldn't be happier, well worth the cost.",2024-02-14T21:53:53,Al W G,https://www.asus.com,True

272670110,4,"A lil bit expensive for the space, but i take it.","One thing keep in mind that if you are using 360 rad AIO, you cannot use it the way Gamernexus suggest. I have H150 capellix so vertical mount is the only option, the cut out is not big enough for the tube to come out from the bottom. 

My best suggestion is any 240mm AIO. I tried to fit a 280 NZXT and have a hard time to fit it in the top. 
Nice looking case and easy to build.

The other factor that you need to keep in mind is you cannot do push pull fan configuration for the bottom section of the 360 Rad due to the cut out side and you will have to move you hard drive base closer to the rad to make rooms for power supply cable. 

I had too many Lianli SL 120 from the old case, so i transfer them over here. The reason that i have 3 vertical fans is to increase the air flow to the bottom of my GPU. My 3070 normally at 40F idle, with these 3 fans, my GPU come down to a cool 30 ~ 31F and when i run 3Dmark. its only reach 70F.

Aware that when you install the screw in the case make sure that you put it straight, i kinda bended a small section of the a lil bit due to hurry when i installed my PSU

Make sure that you have a good static pressure fans since the front glass versions might reduce the amount of airflow into the case
Good looking case though.",2021-12-06T23:24:55,Game,Best Buy US,True
298313947,5,Corsair technicolor dream case,"I bought this over a year ago and love it. The tempered glass is practically invisible. And It's the perfect mid-tower size. I have an Asus ROG ATX MB & top-mounted Corsair iCUE H100i ELITE CAPELLIX (240mm) that fit in perfectly. My previous mid-tower had a lot of extra open space that made all the parts feel really small and it just looked silly. 
I removed the pre-installed Lighting Node Core & used the Commander Core that came with the AIO instead. And I took out the HD cage (didn't need it + waste of space). The SSD sleds were confusing until I looked up some images online. In the end it all worked out! (even though my cable management is *poor*).
Highly recommend this! Though I am a big Corsair fan so I will almost always recommend them",2023-01-12T19:40:41,abeautifulmine,Best Buy US,True
273450620,5,Best Mid ATX case on the market!,"When it comes to Mid Tower ATX cases - this is about as good as it gets. From construction to its capabilities this is a solid choice and comes in two great color combos Black and White/Gray. PLEASE NOTE - This has a 240 top - therefore you can only fit a 240 rad and not a triple 360 rad - if that is a deal-breaker but you love the case look to the 5000x/7000x as it is the same case just bigger.

Construction- Just like every other PC at this price point, this is created with a metal chassis and tempered front and side glass for optimal RGB. Nothing on this PC felt cheap while building it and even the things that could have been plastic or cheaper were generally above the quality I expected - Especially for $100. It has one USB type C and One USB type A on the front case connectors along with a Mic/headphone port. 

Cable Management - This case comes with a great main channel to route Cables through and several ties for management down the line in the build. You will need your own zip ties, but your cable management opportunity here is based on your skill and not really the case as Corsair has really killed it with this one. 

Features/Fans- The fans that the case comes with are...ok. For $100 you can't expect them to throw in great fans as well so plan to replace them if you are putting anything serious in it but if you are doing an I5 or below you should be good. The case comes with its own RGB hub in the back good for 6 fans but no fan hub like on the 5000x and 7000x and this is probably due to the cost factor so plan on using one of their nodes or some other method for your 6+ fan headers other than what is brought in on this case. Another great feature is every vent you could want a mesh fan filter - has one and they are pretty good! It has three plats in the back for SSD's and a Hard Drive caddy good for two HDDs or four SSD's (must buy an adaptor for the 4ssd's but it has the potential for two out of the box). 

Conclusion - If you like the aesthetic of the case, pull the trigger at BestBuy! They generally have better deals plus your points vs corsair. This was a great case to build in and I have zero complaints, I upgraded the fans and added a core (which came with the AIO I got for it so it wasn't additional) and I was all good to go on the case. Truly another Mastercraft example of corsairs ability to build and execute on high-end cases.",2021-12-21T16:02:29,oprib,Best Buy US,True

There are six inputs, the green/orange/black combo from most good computers, red/white RCA, a couple digital audio and so forth. It's easy to switch between them from the control box. I adjust the main volume on the control box, and then fiddle with the volume from the volume control on my keyboard. When you adjust the main volume control on the control box, the speakers in use are lit up. It would have been cool to make the colors adjustable on the control box. They're just orange. Not bad, just would have been nice to make them match the color of the keyboard lights. 

My only complaint is that the control box is light... to light. It can scoot around on the desk. If i were them I would have added a pound of weight inside to keep it in place and help it feel more substantial. Once I get my new computer and monitor all set up I'll probably velcro or command-strip it into place. 

Also, it looks like they were designed to have black mesh speaker covers, but they're not included. When did they stop making the mesh covers? 

Aside from that, truly amazing speakers.",2020-08-04T13:49:21,Snarfy,Best Buy US,True

282396794,5,Ahead of the Pack at any Price!,"The Corsair iCUE 4000X RGB case is the culmination of years of development, and it shows clearly in the iCUE 4000X.  

The case is the best engineered and implemented case I have used for my builds; it dots all the I’s and crosses all the T’s.  

Not one of the cases I have used over decades was so completely thought out built.  Have cases costing far more than the iCUE 4000X that do not come close to the excellence of this build.

Notes:
-	RGB controller is intuitive to use, works great with the ICUE software. 
-	Side panels and the front panel are easily removeable.  
-	Cable management channels are superb.  
-	Magnetic dust filters are easily accessible.  Great stuff

Do not recall a case that something was lacking or just not right, not the 4000x, they got it right.

If you are looking for a case that delivers on capacity, ease of installation, airflow cooling, upgradable, solid build and delivers at a fraction of the cost of many cases give the iCUE 4000X a look.  It is truly a Winner.",2022-07-10T22:16:39,vrs99,Best Buy US,True
269159624,5,"Good design,","Great casing. Silent fans, a 3-fan AIO up-to 360mm can be installed on top-side which has a magnetic sheet which you can just lift and screw the radiator without having to dismember anything at all.

Some people might suspect that the radiator or fans of AIO might get stuck in ram but this is not the case. It still has more than 2 inches of gap so you can plug in/out cables pretty easy right under it. 

The front panel is glass so an AIO with outward airflow at the front is not recommended. Its great for inward flow however, since it pulls air in from gaps on the side.

Right now, I am getting 35~39 degrees on my 5800x processor while there is no load on it. (iCUE image attached)

I did not feel the need to buy a modular PSU since it was easy for me to just hide unused cables behind PSU box.

It has its own Corsair ARGB controller at the back. Came with pre-installed corsair branded straps and some extra ones, zip ties, all mounting screws and easy to follow installation manual.

The side glass is darkish but you can still see pretty much everything inside once its turned on. Its more of a personal choice, since i like darkish glass which gives it its own feel.

Good money for the buck. Some things I do not like include only 1 USB slot at the top, it does have a headphone Jack. I wish the doors were hinged rather than using nubs, same with the back cover.

298418803,3,Case looks beautiful but has some issues,So like the title implies the case looks very nice. But it doea have some things im not super thrilled about.  First thing is corsair please include the rear fan with these cases because without it it has terrible flow.   I run a 5600x asus x570 and a rtx 3080 currently.  Anyway so i had this thing air cooled at first and twmps were up mid 90s twrrible so i added a rear fan got them down to mid 80s  took the side panel off low 70s . This is all under full game load.  And those are cpu temps. Anyway ended up putting a liquid cooler in the case h115i lets say its probably to thick for this case on top but thata where it is now just touching the ram. Not my favorite but it works the problem is the 140 fans on h115 are too thick.  The h110 fits perfectly and i would go.thst direction n3ct build. But with all that in there it runs 72 to 76 under full load 1440p or 4k .  The last issue is if you want to vertical mount the card which looks cool its too close to the glass to be actually usefull. It overheats the graphulics card and im talking 92 so thats useless with a 3080 or probably any large card i would assume. Hopefully that answers many questions  if i could rate it a 3.5 i think thats a accurate number.,2023-01-13T21:37:15,IFS1,Best Buy US,True

When I removed it I found that all the tabs on one side had either broken off or were bent. Looking at the bezel it isn’t reinforced very well which is ironic because it acts as the two front feet of the case so it’s job should be to withstand weight/force.

299376058,5,Great cooling and stylish,"Corsair makes some solid cases and others have more airflow than this. However, I haven't had any issues with this case. I wanted a glass front and something that came with fans. These aren't Corsair's top end fans, but they work. I added another LL120 fan on the rear exhaust so I could use the controller it comes with. Corsair does not let you mix and match fans with their controller.

You technically can, but controlling the RGB doesn't work out. I paired this case with an additional LL120 fan and their H100i elite LCD AiO. I paid more for their LCD AiO, but it looks nice, and I wanted to use one program (iCUE) for managing all RGB.

I have iCUE set all fans to quiet operation. My system consists of a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and RTX 4070Ti graphics card. I put five temperature probes throughout my tower so I could measure the air temperature coming into the case (top and bottom), what's coming directly into the graphics card under it (above the power supply shield), what's leaving the back exhaust, and what's being pushed through the AiO out the top.

Internal case temperatures while gaming never go above 40°C while my CPU sits at 65°C. My graphics card gets warmer, around 80°C, but it's a power hungry 4070Ti and it's still well below any levels of concern.

Overall, I'm pleased with this case and the performance it provides. I could probably get some cooler temperatures with one of their airflow cases, but I prefer the way this one looks. The front glass is a nice touch and the glass around the system is easy to see through. I do wish it was 1-2"" taller for easier cable management, especially since I have 6 fans with RBG, the LCD AiO, and 4 of Corsair's LED strips all paired to four Corsair controller boxes each requiring SATA power. Things would be an absolute mess if I didn't have a modular power supply.

There are options for cable management in the back, and Corsair gives you 5-6 Velcro cable straps and a dozen or so small zip ties. There are multiple hooks and loops for cable management, it still becomes a mess when there's this much lighting in it.

Either way, there's plenty of space for 40-series and 7000-series graphics card and adequate cooling.",2023-01-27T12:59:01,Pablo,Best Buy US,True

Air flow is good, and I get and maintain great temps, even when stressing/Gaming for long sessions. The PSU Bay Area can be tight if you plan to use the hdd cage and if the PSU is long,  or an issue with my Seasonic focus 1000w.

295645899,5,"Fantastic, spacious and good looking!","I recently ordered many computer parts from different sources and when I was finally got home from college started putting them all together when I noticed that the case I ordered from Amazon came badly damaged so I refunded it but I needed a case within the next two days otherwise I wouldn't be able to finish building the computer before going back to college so I bought this one from best buy to replace the broken iCue 5000x rgb and i was worried that this case would not fit all of my components but it fit perfectly and was an easy build experience! Absolutely love this case! For those wondering what I fit into the case: Asus ROG z-690-A motherboard which is full size atx motherboard (but the case has holes for smaller boards so there is no need to worry about that) an rtx 3080, a 360 mm AIO water cooler (corsair) you will need to front mount any 360mm water cooler as the top of the case does not have space for more than a 240mm aio so that is something to be aware of. I have a 1000 watt power supply this does make it so that i cannot have any hdd drives since The cables from the power supply take up that extra space but if you have a smaller power supply you can fit the hdd mount just fine. it also has two two ssd mounts in the back of the case behind the cable management cover that are very useful for more storage that I will definitely take advantage of in the future!",2022-12-16T22:40:10,PatrickS,Best Buy US,True
261807573,3,"Decent case, decent airflow, iCue bad","Decent case, I enjoyed that it came with the three 8-LED fans in the front plus a node inside the case to connect those fans to. Easy to build in for the most part, and the design of the case looks very nice.
Their glass side-panel mounting solution could be better, the side panel feels pretty much suctioned to the case which caused me to shatter my first one (super fun) and always gives me resistance so it can be dreadful to take off for getting inside the PC, which is obviously necessary. 
My real gripe lies on the other side, towards the back of the MOBO. I'm running the 850W PSU from Corsair, and the cables are so thick (mainly the 24-pin) that even pressed all the way against the back of my case, it still causes the outer panel to bend, and (not trying to flex) my cable management inside the case is pretty much flawless. Rather ironic I would say, that I pair a corsair PSU with a Corsair Case, and their cables won't even fit in the back panel properly, which makes adding cable extensions or extra fan headers to this case pretty much a nightmare. 
Also, I know this is a common thing for RGB fans, but the double wires for one fan (one for RGB and one for actual fan control) is a little ridiculous. If you're mix-and-matching fans from Corsair, like me (one LL fan, and five 8-LEDs) you (might) have to get an extra node/header to control them since they use one fan to tell the others what to do, or else the RGB won't work properly on one series of fans (I could've planned for this better, but really). 
You might know this, but iCue can be pretty awful. Most recently, I was having an issue where my fans connected through a Commander Pro would go on and off every 5 seconds and a USB-disconnect sound would sound every time the fans would turn on and off, and my fans would go full-throttle when it happened. I fixed it by disabling some USB setting, but most of the forums I visited said it's an issue with other programs interfering with RGB control, so take that as you will.
THERMALS AND NOISE PERFORMANCE: I'm running a Gigabyte 2080 super and an i7-9700K (stock OC, same voltage) with a h100i Elite Cappelix 240mm AIO mounted at the top of the case (there's an option for 280mm but my RAM, corsair vengeance RGB, barely had clearance with the 240). My CPU never goes above 65 degrees and same with my GPU, so I can't complain about that. 
Under load, I would say the noise level is alright, it can be quite loud but the tone of the noise isn't unpleasant. Compared to something like the jet engine of a PS4, this is way better, it just sounds like a really big fan blowing wind without any mechanical noises or whirring, so I would say a clean sound. 

PROS:
- RGB looks nice especially with smoked panels, overall very sleek-looking case
- Decent-good airflow and performance.
- Relatively easy to build in.
CONS:
- Area behind MOBO for cable management is too small for Corsair PSU cables, bends my side-panel even without stacking wires + good cable management.
- iCue is not good
- Glass side-panel mounting needs improvement, can be annoying
- If running with Corsair fans, LOTS OF WIRES

In short: I love the way it looks and it performs well, but for individuals who are less experienced, it can be quite tedious to deal with Corsair's software if pairing with other Corsair peripherals. If you're not looking to build with Corsair fans, go find another case 100%! Be wary of pairing with a PSU that uses thick cables.",2021-05-31T16:31:56,MasterDurandalsTopFan,Best Buy US,True

8006929,5,Great Computer Speaker System,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] By far, this is the best Computer speaker system I have owned. The sound is great and the generous 200-watt (RMS) and THX-Certified makes for big, bold and clean audio experience. Furthermore, the subwoofer is so powerful; I never have to turn it past 50%; it even sounds great at lower volume settings.

Equally as important, for me, and what cemented my decision in choosing the Logitech - Z623 2.1 Speaker System was that the controls are on the satellite speakers, which are at arms length away on top of my desk. Other systems did not offer such an option – they had the controls on the sub-woofer, which is simply not desirable for me.",2012-08-16T15:31:52,Scottie03,Chicago,False

308200775,5,"High-Power, Versatile, and Sustainable: A Sound Sy","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been truly impressed with this sound system. The 330W power, split between the 130W subwoofer and 100W satellites, is incredible, delivering high-quality sound that has enriched my gaming, music, and video experiences. The system’s compatibility is remarkable, working with everything from computers and TVs to game consoles.

Three key reasons make this system a must-buy. First, the THX certification ensures premium sound quality. Second, the system’s versatility with easy 3.5mm and RCA connections is superb. Lastly, its carbon-neutral certification emphasizes a commitment to sustainability. This sound system offers an outstanding listening experience and is well worth the investment.",2023-06-10T15:13:29,LogiGamer,Best Buy US,True

I had a cheap $20 set of logitech speakers that lasted me 7 years that finally gave out today. So I went and picked this up. Wow. These speakers are impressive! The bass is awesome and you can adjust it to your liking. The speakers can get veryyy loud and at first it may feel like the mids and highs are lackluster but they are very pure. You can hear so many different things going on and the sound is very crisp. Even on max volume there is no distortion just the sound being amplified.

I occasionally listen to my Apple Music subscription. The speakers sounds great for the price point, they are clear, bass is defined, not overpowering, mids and highs are good, leaning towards the bright side I’d say. They are not audiophile grade by any means. If I had to complain, I’d say the propriety cable from the right speaker to the sub is clunky, but not a deal breaker. The speaker finish and look is minimal, doesn’t look premium like the computer but can’t expect that for the cheap price.",2020-02-02T18:36:09,Michael88,Best Buy US,True
216831306,5,The higher cost is worth it to me.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are excellent Logitech speakers! I recommend them. There are cheaper speaker sets that may not sound as clear or may not have as rich of bass. There are more expensive sets out there too but, IMO, you would have to be a true audiophile to pay more. They look good and are built very sturdy. There are multiple input options too as mentioned in the web-page description. 
CONS? not many. Price might be a bit too high for some. The smaller speakers wire directly into the sub-woofer in a proprietary set up. So if for some reason the sub-woofer goes out then the desktop speakers are basically useless. This really shouldn't be an issue but it is a pet peeve of mine. See the attached picture with the connection. Also, no Bluetooth connections.",2019-04-20T02:26:37,RobKansas,Kansas,True

For the price youll be hard pressed to find a better sounding setup off the rip. With a decent sound card and a little fine tuning these things sound very good and clear but also deliver just the right amount of bass and punch. I would recommend these over the promedia set from Klipsch due to the 2 key features that make them better : they have a on off switch; and no Bluetooth over riding all inputs!,2018-08-13T11:25:46,hitman1985,"Clarksville,TN",True
254592496,5,Good for a whole lot of scenarios.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I bought my new Dell all-in-one computer, my existing five speaker arrangement would not hook up. Drat! I loved that old sound system. However, after looking at several different (affordable) speaker systems, this set stood out as one that might just do the job. I get hooked on YouTube music videos and can waste an entire afternoon 'rocking out'!  These speakers are great. Lots of volume, and the base is easily adjustable from the knob on the right-side speaker, as is the volume. In fact, the base can be adjusted to an almost unbearable level . . .

They work great on the minimal number of games I own (Wreckfest, Blackhawk Down, and Flight Simulator). Day-to-day news folks I watch on YouTube and Rumble as well. 

Yup, I really like these speakers and would tell anyone who isn't an audiophile that they're a good choice.",2021-03-06T17:48:27,MrTommy,Best Buy US,True

273286088,5,Impressive for the price and size,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are plug & play and come with everything you need. The amp is built into one of the speakers, and you use the included speaker wire to connect both. Only one power cable for the pair of speakers. 

It comes with an RCA to AUX cable, so connecting them to a computer is straitforward. This is going to make a great Christmas present for someone who doesn't know about amps or audio related stuff, but wants good audio and a simple setup.

I tested them first and this is a huge step above those cheap Logitech and other PC speakers in a box. Even though these are small bookshelf speakers, they're able to pump out some bass. Not super low bass, but it still has some impact. It gets loud from up close, and the treble from the silk dome tweeters is not harsh. They're no where near as clear as my studio monitors in the picture, but the person recieving these has never had bookshelf speakers.

Long story short, if you're trying to get audio from your computer and want something that's actually nice to listen to music or watch videos, spend a little bit more if you can for a decent pair of bookshelf speakers like these.",2021-12-18T04:40:17,danyul,Best Buy US,True

270392075,4,The screens are the weakest link. - Good overall,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are good speakers. The remote though doesn’t seem to turn them on. The power from the remote will only turn the blue mode on. I’m guessing this is the Bluetooth mode. But when this happens I can’t hear the speakers at all. The remote doesn’t even turn them fully on where the light is green. Only when the light is green am I able to hear them. When manually powered on green one speaker will turn on and then small wait time the other will turn on. But it does have good sound and they look nice. The screen cover over the speakers is the only thing besides the plug that looks cheap. The screens look like they used just any off brand screen and glued them on. I would have liked a more durable stronger screen. These feel like one poke just from moving them with puncher the screen. The price is the thing that I didn’t like the most. I just don’t feel like they were worth the almost two hundred dollar market. These are just basic good speakers I’m happy with them but if I were to move I don’t know if they would stay in One piece especially the screens.,2021-10-11T03:35:18,HalfAMind,Best Buy US,True

252597559,5,Easy to use and extremely long battery,"I have had the 1040 for a little over a month and it’s traveled about 150ish miles. The 1040 is very user friendly and intuitive. It easily sinks with my HR, Cadence and speed sensors. I do enjoy the larger screen as compared to the 840 and it does not have too much glare. I was concerned about glare from some online reviews I viewed, but it’s extremely easy to see and does well in low light or bright sun. 

I would say the one drawback is the hill assist as it is usually delayed, in that I am already climbing the hill, then it tells me there is a hill ahead. Once on the climb it does well with gradients and it also delays in telling you the hill is completed. But I know I’m done. 

The Battery has not been charged since my initial out of the box 100% charge. Unit is currently at 60% power.  That’s after approximately 15 hours of use to include riding and a few hours of dorking around with it getting used to all the submenus and initial setup. 

Additionally, it is very fast to turn on and ready to use. I ride with guys using wahoo and hammerheads and I’m ready to go and they are still booting up. Secondly, if a ride is changed. It’s an easy fix. Just pull off of ride with GPS export as a GPX file and then Bluetooth to the 1040. I can have a whole new route uploaded in under 30 seconds.

2.	Internal 2.5” Drive Bays (4 up to 9), 2.5” Drive bays: Four on back of case (Page 18 manual) Six if one includes the pre-installed drive cage (Page 19 manual), Seven if one installed a 2.5” drive on the multifunction cover (page 7 and 8 manual).

3.	If ASUS provided the additional 3.5” drive bay and two additional 2.5” drive brackets that fit behind the motherboard one could install eleven 2.5” drives. Or one could install four 3.5” drives and Seven 2.5” drives.

341437800,5,Great Speakers Made for PC Gaming,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent PC speakers. You have to install the software and get a little familiar with the button on the control, speaker, but it comes pretty easily and intuitively. In the SteelSeries Engine software you can set a default lighting mode so you can have smooth RGB spectrum even when your PC is off and you are using Bluetooth connection. It defaults to the music mode. The sound is tuned best for gaming, but listening to music is fine too. These are not audiophile speakers, they are gaming speakers. Voice has a little more punch because there is no enclosure, all the bass comes from the subwoofer. The result is really clear vocal range, which is great for gaming and also watching youtube or podcasts. You will hear the voice with less volume. Important because overall since these are digital and not amplified total max volume is not super high; you can't fill out an entire house with these. But an entire room yes. A very nice middle line for someone living in house suite with neighbors. In a regular apartment that could be different, but in my situation I don't think I'm really bothering anyone with the sub in normal gaming.

They also look great, since they don't have the boxy enclosure. With the RGB on they look quite classy and PC gamey. But they stealth out nice with the RGB off too. 

At $300 I wouldn't have considered, this but on sale at $250 this is a decent deal. It's still a little more expensive than some 2.1 units but you get everything you would expect from this setup for a PC with this product. Oh, and it comes with the USB-C cable too, which is appreciated.",2024-04-13T01:52:52,Sputnik,Best Buy US,True

243389415,5,Brought Netflix Nature documentary to LIFE !!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It’s been quite some time since I’ve purchased a dedicated computer sound system, and have grown accustomed to using bluetooth earbuds, or built-in computer monitor speakers, that _seemed_ adequate enough.

Well, after launching a David Attenborough Nature video on YouTube and comparing the difference, I now see what I’ve been missing. Affordable computer audio got good real fast.

His voice had the deep baritone and breathiness that brought the Serengeti to life. My wife was working in her office a room away and perked right up and came in to comment how clear and good the computer sounded. 

I have to admit though that I felt stupid setting the system up, no instructions but none needed right, just plug and play audio. What I did not realize is that the control puck is required (operates on supplied AA batteries) and the pairing mode switch below the unit selects between modes. Once I uncovered this “a-ha” moment I was hooked. 


PROS
————
+ Innovative control puck is brilliant 
+ super simple setup, good wire lengths 
+ sound quality for cheap system is surprisingly good 
+ deeper bass than you’d think by looking at the sub size 
+ incredibly affordable price well above entry-level quality 
 
CONS
———
-plastic speakers and control puck feel cheaply made
-I had to look in the manual to operate and insert puck batteries 
-lack of THX certification like higher-end model 
-full wireless would make this truly next-gen 

CONCLUSION 
————————
I thought I was fine using LG UltraWide 38” monitor built-in speakers (no slouch) for audio. I’ve had dedicated systems in the past but they were embarrassingly low-quality, tinny sound, cumbersome wires, and unsightly. 

While not perfect (can we lose all the wires?) the Logitech Z407 resolves any previous complaints, and earns a solid BUY recommendation.",2020-11-17T23:12:00,TechReviews,"Kennesaw, GA",False
241549275,5,Remarkable Sound and Features,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been a fan of logitech for over a decade now and have used many of their products from mices and keyboards to headsets so when I say the Logitech - Z407 Bluetooth speaker I decided to give it a try. Inside the box, you’re first greeted with a quick setup guide on the inside cover, followed by the subwoofer, two stereo satellite speakers and their stands , the wireless remote, a pair of AAA batteries, the necessary connecting cables including a 3.5mm audio cable and some paperwork.
 
Setting this system up was a breeze, as soon as you put the batteries into the wireless remote and plug the power cord that's attached to the subwoofer into an outlet the two are instantly connected and you hear a sound that signifies this. The wireless remote by default was in the bluetooth pairing mode( noted by a blue blinking light on the remote) and I tried pairing it to both my phone and my computer and there were no issues there. You are also given the opportunity to connect not only by bluetooth but also by 3.5mm audio cable and also a usb audio cable (not provided in box). Each of these ports can be found on the back of the subwoofer. 

Some things to note are that the dial is very intuitive to use. Not only are the controls displayed on the transparent wrap covering the dial but if you have used any recent bluetooth headphone the controls will be familiar such as depressing the control once to play/stop and double depressing to skip to the next song etc. Turning clockwise increases the volume and anticlockwise decreases it. You are also able to control the bass level from the remote. Depressing the remote for more than 5 secs will put you into bass control (noted by a distinct sound that plays) where increasing/decreasing is based on clockwise/anticlockwise turns. To exit bass mode just depress the remote again until the sound is heard once more. On the underside of the remote u will find the plate you need to remove to insert/remove batteries as well as two buttons, one for bluetooth connectivity and one that cycles through the other two audio connection modes, i.e 3.5mm cable (magenta) and usb cable(white). The satellite speakers design allows for their stand to be either placed at their base or at their sides allowing for vertical and horizontal orientation. I greatly appreciate having this option and can tell I’ll be going back and forth between these two stances.

So how do they sound…. Great. I have had more expensive computer systems and at this price point and sound I am all in. I threw various audio files and programs at it, even games and I was still pleasantly surprised at how well it performed. Interestingly enough I must say audio sounded better/ more impressive when connected through bluetooth ( I swear!!). Music and movies sounded great and the bass was just enough to feel enough boom to the audio without any distortion even when the bass mode was at max.I must also note that the remote control effect was instantaneous, meaning I noticed no lag while using the remote.

This system is great and despite this I know it is not for everybody. If you recently got a new setup or even if you don’t and you’re just looking to upgrade an older system you’ve had for while without breaking the bank, I highly suggest this. You have multiple connection options including Bluetooth and the sound is great.",2020-10-29T18:12:30,Jaydozrock,NY,False
241686622,5,Great design and sound to match,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am always listening to music, so when opportunities to review headphones, earbuds and speakers come around - I jump right in. 

Pros:
Wireless volume control
Great sound
Easily tuned subwoofer levels

Cons:
Dial bottom grip affected by dusty and can then slip around
Loud mode change (volume vs sub) chime
Inconsistent browser interaction

While opening the box for these Logitech Z704 speakers for setup, the wireless volume dial was right up top. While unpacking, it’s noticeable that all three pieces of the setup were packaged well. The speakers require their own wire with color-coded RCA plug to the subwoofer. The length of the wire is enough that I can use them without issue on my motorized stand-up desk in stand-up mode without putting strain on the cables.

The speakers are a bit bigger than I had anticipated from seeing images. When on their side, they are 8 inches (20 cm) wide by just shy of 4 inches (10 cm) high and 3 inches (7.6 mm) deep at the biggest dimensions.. They ALMOST fit under my home made monitor stand as the front is too tall and therefore can’t go completely under (see pic).

Pairing was quite simple given the button on the bottom of the dial. I paired it very quickly with both an Alienware Aurora R9 running Windows 10 and Google Pixel Slate running ChromeOS. Bluetooth selection from the device will steal it from the active one once paired, as expected and a chime indicates that there was some sort of pairing accomplished. 

This set also supports 3.5mm audio sources and those that connect via USB when hooked up to the subwoofer, should you not want to (or are not able to) use Bluetooth. Switching between the modes (USB/3.5/BT) is as easy as pushing a button under the dial right next to the Bluetooth pairing button. 

The wireless volume dial is a great idea and uses AAA batteries. It has a decent rubberized grip on the bottom, but make sure you dust your placement area first, the dial will slide around if it’s dusty. 

During all my initial use after setup, the subwoofer was emitting a static sound & popping. I reached out to Logitech with a video of the issue and it was replaced very quickly. The rest of the review is based on the replacement speaker set.

I found the volume dial to be very responsive when in use. When your computer or other device goes to sleep, so does the dial. At that point, you have to tap and wait a second or two for it to wake up, so you can adjust the volume again. For example, I was listening for a while and got a call and I found that rotating the dial to lower the volume, didn’t do anything. Pressing down on the dial and waiting a few seconds gave me control back; I’d almost rather the action of rotating the dial be enough to wake it from a sleep / power save state.

Adjusting the bass by holding down the dial is good and saves me from going under the desk for a manual adjustment on other vendors, however the chime to let you know you’re in subwoofer adjustment mode (vs volume mode) is LOUD! A chime more in line with the current volume would be better, but at least you know you’re adjusting the bass for that moment. 

Control of pause/skip/rewind does NOT work on Windows Chrome or the YouTube Music (YTM) App, but it does with Edge. Weird. Controlling the audio / music stream in ChromeOS with YTM in either Chrome or the App, works as expected. It’s tough to go to Chrome on Windows from ChromeOS and lose pause / skip capabilities for a browser you use primarily; I don’t like using Edge. On a side note, a nice minor change to the dial, would be a slight indentation for your finger, if you wanted to spin the top to adjust the volume like you were using a Google Home speaker, vs spinning it at the middle.

I’m happy with Sound, the bass and overall appearance of the Logitech Z704 speakers. I listen to most genres of music, but am more regularly a Cali Reggae and Alternative Rock listener. From guitar to keyboards and brass, these speakers are nice and pack a punch when pressed to do so.

If you need a nice 2.1 computer speaker set and don’t mind that the speakers need to be hard-wired to the subwoofer, I’d say pick these up. If you have a Tenkeyless keyboard (like me!) and it doesn’t have volume control, the wireless dial is a time and annoyance saver.

Or, if you have anything that supports a 3.5mm plug for output and no Bluetooth (old iPod, Echo Dot, etc.), this will bring life back to the old device and/or add superior audio value wherever it’s used.

Overall, it’s a nice setup and if the design works for you, I have no doubt that the sound will be delivered.",2020-10-31T01:46:40,nhtechie,"Nashua, NH",False
241990913,5,"Incredible Versatility, Sound, and Value","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using Logitech's entry-level $25 computer speakers for years and had never really given any thought to upgrading them until I saw the Z407 announced. I had to do a double-take when I saw the price: a subwoofer, Bluetooth, and wireless controls for under $80? Seemed too good to be true, but I'm happy to report that Logitech has delivered a superb speaker system at a remarkable price.

=== SETUP ===
The system comes in a compact but surprisingly heavy box. Be prepared to remove a lot of packaging and wrapping as the box is tightly packed. Unfortunately, the only setup and operating instructions provided are printed on the flaps at the top of the box, and it consists entirely of pictures and no text. Luckily, it's pretty straightforward to connect the system to a computer using the standard aux cable (included). The subwoofer basically acts as the hub of the system, with both speakers connecting directly to the subwoofer, and then the subwoofer plugged into your power outlet. There are certainly a lot of wires to deal with, so you'll want to have some cable ties handy or a desk big enough to hide the wires behind.

My only complaint is that it's not immediately obvious how you switch the system between wired and Bluetooth modes. When I first plugged it into my computer I thought I had received a defective unit. Turns out you have to flip over the wireless control dial and select the desired input using a very small dedicated button. If you want to switch to Bluetooth, there's a Bluetooth button. There is a picture demonstrating this on the box, but again, without any written instructions, it's easy to miss.

I love how the speakers can be positioned either vertically or horizontally based on your desk size or personal preferences. There is a removable stand for each speaker that makes it very easy to switch orientations.

=== CONNECTIONS AND CONTROLS ===
The system supports Bluetooth, 3.5mm wired, and USB connections. Everything is controlled through the wireless dial. The dial looks neat and functions just fine, but you'll probably want to download the full user guide from Logitech's website so you can learn all of it's functions and what the each light color means (white = USB; purple = 3.5mm; blue = Bluetooth). The only way to switch between these three connections is via the buttons on the bottom of the dial. I really wish there was an iOS app or Windows application that would make this easier.

Rotating the dial adjusts volume. To adjust the bass level, press and hold the dial for 2 seconds until you hear a tone, and then rotate the dial to adjust bass. Unfortunately, there no way to tell how many levels of adjustment there are (for either volume or bass). Additionally, the dial does not adjust the volume directly on your computer, so you have two volume levels to consider: whatever your computer is set to, and the volume level of the Logitech speakers set by the wireless dial.

You can also control audio tracks using the dial, but only when connected via USB or Bluetooth. One click = play/pause; two clicks = skip forward; 3 clicks = rewind. There is so much going on with the dial that I had to print out the user manual from Logitech's website to keep on my desk. I'm sure I will memorize all of it eventually.

=== SOUND QUALITY ===
Simply put, I don't think you'll find better sounding computer speakers in this price range. The down-firing subwoofer adds some much-needed oomph compared to a cheaper two-speaker system. And luckily, the subwoofer is relatively small and should fit in almost any setup. With the bass turned up about two thirds of the way, the lows on this system rival those of an entry-level TV sound bar.

As someone who has been working from home for the past several months, I always play music from iTunes while working at my computer. And the Z407 truly fills my apartment with rich, full-bodied sound. It won't rival premium, multi-channel home theater systems, but for a 2.1 computer speaker system, I'm really blown away by the audio quality. Vocals and mids are crisp and not drowned out by the subwoofer. The bass is just punchy enough so as to not completely annoy my neighbors.

=== OVERALL ===
If you're looking for computer speakers that are a step above the average $20 or $30 pair, then the Z407 is an excellent option. It can play audio from virtually any source over 3.5mm, USB, and Bluetooth. It is stylish, compact, and offers incredible audio quality for the price. The wireless dial has a bit of a learning curve, and I wish there were some sort of app to control the system -- but other than that, there's very little to complain about. Highly recommended!",2020-11-03T19:59:16,ryanmcv,"Phoenix, AZ",False
241582944,5,Amazing sound for the price,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me just start off with this if you’re looking for a speaker set up and don’t need something that is portable to carry around I strongly suggest you should consider the Logitech Z407. With that being said let me tell you why.

The sound coming out of this 2.1 system is amazing. For my mid-size apartment, it was able to fill my living room with a rich clear sound with the down-firing subwoofer providing some clean hitting bass. My expectations when I saw how small it was were low. Don’t let the size fool Logitech has managed to pack in some serious punch on a small package that won’t take much space. If I did a blindfold sound test without knowing what it was I would say it sounds like something that would cost an upward of $200 and up. Just an FYI I have hardwood floors so in a carpeted environment, your mileage might vary. Since it has multiple input options you can use it as a computer speaker, 2.1 stereo system to upgrade your Tv/Game Console audio, or just stream some music from your mobile device via Bluetooth or 3.5mm aux cable. Logitech has created a very versatile audio setup that instantly upgrades the sound from built-in stock speakers. Another great feature is the control that looks like a hockey puck. The control unit allows you to pair your devices via Bluetooth, switch from Bluetooth to a wired connection, and control music playback. It does require x2 AAA batteries that Logitech does provide in the box. 

Here’s a rundown of the specs:

Total Watts: RMS 40w Peak 80w
Satellites Speakers: 10w each 
Subwoofer: 20w
3.5mm input
Micro-USB input
Bluetooth 5.0

Control Puck: 
Power, volume, bass control, mute, unmute, track forward, rewind, Bluetooth pairing, source switch buttons .etc, on wireless control.


Overall:
I was highly impressed with what Logitech was able to accomplish on both ends price and quality. The sound that it reproduces rivals speakers that can cost twice as much. I would even consider the Logitech Z407 over some of the big Bluetooth speakers unless portability is a must for you.

258433122,5,Rock & Roll!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This speaker set rocks! It's a great value for the quality. Negative reviews must be mostly from nit-picking about the term ""wireless,"" the wireless controller itself, or from audiophiles with unrealistic expectations. 

Firstly, yes, it is wireless, because it has Bluetooth, and a wireless controller. The satellite speakers themselves are not wireless, they plug into the subwoofer like most computer speaker systems. 

Second, I read a lot of complaints about the wireless controller. It comes with a plastic protector with the functions printed on it. (See pic) We will just leave it there until we have them memorized, and I also have a picture now in case we forget a function, but really it's not hard to remember. The only difficult part about that is the functions being different if you use the USB input.

These are obviously inexpensive speakers. But you get 3 different ways to connect, Bluetooth, 3.5 mm audio jack, (cable included) and USB. And you get a great sounding system with wireless control. It doesn't look bad, either. 

These more than fill our bedroom with sound, they enhance everything we're listening to. We use them mainly for watching movies and TV shows, which it is excellent for. The dialog isn't drowned out by the lows.

They aren't bad at all for listening to music, either. They sound almost as good as our Sony sound bar system that cost almost 4x as much! Very pleased with this purchase, I'm glad I waited for these instead of settling for a different set.",2021-04-19T00:14:22,XJ650Maxim,Best Buy US,True

241543548,3,decent speakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Logitech 2.1 Bluetooth speakers is a great entry point for anyone looking to get some decent sound quality at a fair price. There are some areas it does fall short so hopefully this review will help with your buying decisions.

Let's talk about the basics here real quick. Out of the box your going to get your two speakers, main bass box, all the necessary wires and a wireless hub to control sound and playback. Let me start by saying this is a Bluetooth set up and not a wireless set up. The only thing that is wireless is the sound hub which runs off of 2 AAA batteries. Set up is very easy and can be done either via Bluetooth or through the provided 3.5 mm cable. I tested this against my ps4, android phone, and PC. Both set ups worked really good through Bluetooth except my pc. While trying to run it through the Bluetooth audio was badly distorted and would not come through crystal clear. I can't really blame Logitech for this as i don't truly know where the problem lies. What i ended up having to do was run the speakers to my PC through the 3.5 mm cable and everything worked just fine. One thing i was disappointed to see was the lack of a app to allow further customization of sound control and quality, mainly speaking of the bass speaker. The Bass speaker looks nice and with a downward facing subwoofer i was really hoping this thing would shake the ground when the bass hit. I was wrong however. Sound quality on this set up seems to focus more on clarity and vocals then it does on any other area. While playing games like COD, bass was decent around explosions and could be felt. Now don't get me wrong bass can be adjusted through the wireless hub however even at full setting it just seems like the unit is trying to hard to push it through. That's not to say the sound quality is horrible because its not. Your going to pick up on vocals and your highs very well and with very good quality, however compared to some of my other speakers that i have that are very identical to this set up, the Logitech falls short of keeping up. Through the wireless audio hub you can do some basic task like raise the volume, pause the track and skip/rewind the next track and well that's pretty much it.

Overall guys im keeping this review short because, well basically this unit is as average as it gets. There's not a whole lot of features, and there is no use of a app to control features or fine tune your audio device Sound and voice quality is very clear with decent bass however that's about where it ends. I own a lot of Logitech products and for me this would be a hard pass for two reasons. One, i like full control of my audio sounds via a provided equalizer, and two certain sound qualities are lacking. Over all this is a great set up if you are on a budget or looking for some discreet speakers. For most people this is going to be enough however im very picky when it comes to my audio and at the end of the day for me, this a basic set up at best and nothing else.",2020-10-29T16:59:15,Crasher,"littleton, Colorado",False

242858093,5,Blown Away,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It has been a while since I've purchased speakers - my last audio purchase was a sound bar about 3 years back for $250 - so I didn't know what to expect for under $100. 

I wanted a sound system that could hook up to my PC physically, and my Bluetooth Record Player in the next room over (I'm not an audiophile, I just collect Video Game soundtracks, so the BT connection was my choice for now). I thought, 'if they suck I'll just take them back and connect to my sound bar' - but I fell in love with it immediately when I get it out of the box. 

The speakers look clean (I love the ability to turn them on their sides with the included platform), and the size if perfectly compact, blending into my setup easily. Connection was easy to both my PC and my BT Record Player. I would go with this model compared to the other because the Wireless Controller is an incredible addition to the experience. It makes switching audio modes quick and simple, and offers easy access for audio controls, too. 

Last but not least - the audio quality. I know I said I'm not an audiophile, but I know when things sound good. Everyone in the apartment was blown away and in love with the warm tones and bass you can feel in your chest.

241408508,4,"All the essentials and then some, but not perfect","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For a set of desktop speakers to be truly great, they have be compact enough to fit on a desk and sound great. It may sound simple, but achieving both of those together requires a delicate balancing act and there aren't many speaker sets that can do it. This Logitech Z407 set delivers good (not great) sound in a versatile package that includes multiple connectivity options and a Bluetooth wireless remote control. The speakers fit nicely on a desk, with a subwoofer that doesn't take up too much real estate, either. Are they great? No. Are they a great deal at $80? Unquestionably. 

At this price, I can recommend them to anyone looking for good sound and great versatility.

~~Hardware and Setup~~
The Logitech Z407 comes packaged in a handsome, compact cardboard box that's small enough to fit under your arm as you carry it out of the store. The inner flap of the box provides a set of pictorial instructions that are enough to help you get started, and the components are packed smartly within. There are two satellite speakers with long cords that end in coax audio plugs, a subwoofer unit with a built-in power cord, a 1/8""-to-1/8"" audio cable about 6 feet long, the Bluetooth control puck, and a set of AAA batteries. I had the whole thing out of the box and set up on the desk in about 5 minutes. 

Following the pictorial directions, I inserted the batteries into the bottom of the control puck, connected the coax plugs from the right and left speakers and plugged the subwoofer in. Then I pressed the Bluetooth button on the bottom of the puck for a couple seconds, which allowed my PC to find and pair to it. That's it! I was able to play music through the speakers within about 7 minutes of opening the box.

The first thing I noticed about the speakers were the satellites feel really cheap in hand. Each one is basically an hollow plastic pill-shaped shell with a driver at one end. It's nice that they're able to be oriented sideways or upright, because it provides some versatility. I chose a horizontal orientation to have one speaker positioned under my second monitor. In this position, the satellite speakers are about 8"" wide, 4"" tall and 3"" deep. 

The puck also feels fairly cheap, even with the batteries inside providing a little extra weight. It has a nice feel when using the volume and tap controls, but it's definitely not built to withstand a lot of abuse. I hope my kids don't get ahold of it. 

~~Usability~~
Like I said above, I had music pumping through these speakers within 7 minutes of opening the box. Setup is pretty intuitive and the pictorial instructions are mostly good enough to fill in the blanks. The control puck is a really nice feature to have in a speaker system at the price. I love being able to control volume and previous/next track without going into any software menus or switching windows/tabs. I also love that the whole setup is virtually wireless on the desktop, as the speaker cables can be attached ""behind the scenes"" so to speak. I like the o

The one thing that I had to take a few seconds to figure out was subwoofer volume control. Pressing the puck down for two seconds switches it from master volume control to subwoofer volume control, and pressing it again lock in the sub volume and returns the control to master volume, but that took me a minute to figure out. Add to this the fact that the sub is turned way down by default, and I spent part of that minute with anemic bass wondering if I got a dud. After figuring it out, I was able to set the subwoofer where I wanted it and all was well. 

I also tested connecting the speakers to my computer using the 1/8"" audio cable and micro USB. Every method of connection works fine, and switching between them is relatively simple (buttons on the bottom of the puck). Most people will just pick one connection type and stick with it. I ended up choosing wired through the headphone jack on my laptop, because it gave the absolute best sound. 

~~Sound~~
Here's where the rubber meets the road. If your speakers don't sound good, they aren't good, no matter how many other functions/options they offer. The good news here is these are good-sounding desktop speakers. Not great, but again, for $80, these are perfectly serviceable, especially when connected to an analog output. 

Getting the speakers set up through Bluetooth was so easy that before I knew it' I'd spent a good deal of time listening to music, and finding myself wondering if these weren't actually very good-sounding at all. I should add that as Bluetooth audio goes, these are perfectly fine, and once your ears attune to the sound, it probably won't sound bad to you at all. But I found myself missing some of the headroom and stereo separation that comes with hi-fi audio. Over a Bluetooth connection, my go-to test tracks felt boxed-in and chopped off at the knees. I see these connect with Bluetooth 5.0, but I'm willing to bet they're not using one of the better audio standards like AptX HD or LC3. 

Fortunately, trying other connections really opened up the sound. Over my laptop's audio-out/headphone jack, clarity and separation was greatly improved. Not so much that you'd mistake these plastic boxes for true hi-fi speakers, but markedly. Especially with electronic music, these speakers really shine. Tracks from Bonobo's Black Sands sparkled and shone with the extra headroom, and the bass was nice and tight in the mix. The plastic revealed itself a bit on ""Come Together"" and ""Something"" from the Beatles' Abbey Road, as Paul McCartney's bass sputtered a bit inside of the cheap speaker shells. 

Somehow, on the micro USB input, the headroom remained but the mix sounded tight and compressed compared to the analog output. I'm guessing there is some extra signal processing in place for the USB output, and the differences are small but noticeable. I'd prefer to use the USB output because I can put the plug in a hub I already use and keep it away from my hands, but suppose I'll have to make do with the analog output to get the best sounding output. In this case, I would have preferred an audio cable with an angled end so I could run the cord along the outside of my laptop.

~~Final word~~
Again, as an $80 consumer-level set of desktop speakers, these are great, and leaps and bounds ahead of what $80 could buy just a few years ago. Be ready to deal with the relatively fragile plastic feel of the speakers and the puck, and be ready to experiment with inputs and outputs to get the right sound for your ears, or just accept that Bluetooth is easy and sounds okay and go with what's simplest.",2020-10-27T23:31:44,benzy,"Portland, OR",False

For example: fans/rad are mounted to a removeable panel, adequate channels for cable mgmt, tons of included tie down straps, multiple options for ssd/hdd, etc. Build quality is great.

The 5000D Airflow is well-designed. My build put a high priority on cooling, since I was planning on overclocking and running programs that would definitely stress the system. 
Building was a breeze. There are channels, pass-throughs, and hold downs everywhere that's needed, allowing for a clean build and proper cable managements. 
The only downside I have is the pass-through for the 2 CPU cables at the top of the motherboard. With a 360mm AIO, they run VERY close to a fan. CARE is required here. 
Other than that, the case is flawless. And it performs. Running a 13700K i7 CPU at 5.6ghz and an overclocked RTX 3080 ti GPU, even under loads, everything stays cool. Running 3D Mark's Time Spy, CPU temperature never exceeds 82°C and the GPU never exceeds 67°C.

It was very convenient that Best Buy had this case is stock as I needed immediately; otherwise my build would have gotten delayed. The store I went to allowed me to exchange.

Two downsides though, hence the 4 stars:
1. It only comes with 2 fans. which for a case called ""airflow"" it would have been nice to have maybe 2 more  fans at least.

2. There's too many extra panels that I didn't end up using, like the backside comes with an internal hinge panel to cover up the cable management; another panel that covers up how cables are routed; there's also two styles of PSU shrouds for the bottom front.  

All these seem unnecessary, which adds to the cost. Without them, the price point could have been lower in the $100 - $120 range.",2022-12-19T15:41:48,NewN10User,Best Buy US,True

346673592,5,The Corsair 7000d is wonderful!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair 7000d is wonderful! The interior is very roomy for all of your hardware and other items. It even has more space once you remove some of the panels and cabinet pieces that hides your wiring and more so if you are not planning to use the hard disk section. 

It is a big and sturdy case! There is still plenty of room for more even after all your parts are in place. I swapped my motherboard and other parts over from a much smaller case and the interior still has so much more space for other things. The case is quite large and heavy due to the solid steel and single glass panel construction.

I removed all the included fans that it came with and replaced them with four 120mm Noctua Redux fans and seven 140mm Noctua Redux fans. The Noctua NH-D15 heat sink that I have been using on the Intel i9-12900k CPU comes with two additional 140mm fans making it thirteen Noctua fans in total. 

Some how this setup has reduced my XFX Radeon 6900 XT Limited Black Edition GPU temperatures from 70-80 degrees Celsius to 50-55 degrees Celsius running Apex Legends as a baseline test for two hours of gameplay!

On top of all that, I purchased the case while it was on sale. The savings alone paid for a set of the Noctua fans. The  Corsair 7000d was well worth the purchase and I don’t know why I did not buy it a few years back when I had built the whole system in the first place.

271540561,5,Quality budget speaker system for gaming,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound quality, no issues whatsoever during the length I have owned it. The satellite speakers are what drove me to buy this initially; I didn't want my desk consumed by large satellites. The size is great, and though I leave the lights off 90% of the time it's still a fun feature. Playing a spooky game? Set it to a low red. It only takes a second to swap. Also looks impressive when it matches the rest of the setup. 

I did not care for the screen color match, though, it was flickery and distracting. I would not recommend buying anything for that feature, it's likely a technology issue not a specific issue with this product. Even my philips hue bulbs have a lag when changing color.

Easy setup, works exactly as advertised. Strong bass, though it's far from the oomphiest on the market I still have to keep it toned down to about 60% to not irritate housemates. Software works well. I do wish that the RGB could work with Corsair Icue for the sake of not having 5 programs controlling RGB, but it's a minor gripe.

I love the additional button you can program atop the right speaker. By default it's set to toggle the light level between bright, medium, low, and off. Very handy feature. You can set it to nearly anything though. (want your speaker to be your control+z? Sure you can do that for some reason.)",2021-11-11T15:40:03,Barb,Best Buy US,True
233895114,4,"Loud and Crisp, but there are some caveats","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these speakers because reviews said they sounded good and the lighting effects are great. Both of these things are true. They are somewhat overpowered - I don't have any scenarios with these speakers where I have to bring them above 30% power (unless I'm connecting via headphones).

The lighting effects are great, if somewhat inconsistent - I keep them as static lights to keep a theme among my other RBG components. Occasionally I will have to bring the control  software (GHub) up to reset settings, because they will change from time to time with no other action.

My main complaint for these speakers are specific to how I need to use them, so it is my fault for not thinking it out more:

The volume control is up/down buttons on the ""right"" speaker. If you are in-game (on most games), it will pull you out momentarily to show the volume level. You can mitigate this by changing volume in-game, but I would really prefer a volume knob.

The headphone jack is on the back of the control speaker, and so it's not easy to access. Again, I saw that ahead of time, but the more I live with these speakers, I really desire a front-facing headphone jack.

These speakers are plenty loud and while I'm not a super audiophile, they are pleasant-sounding but trying to shape the sound via the software equalizer is definitely hit and miss.  The bass response is absolutely outsized in many instances, but I love bass, so I can forgive it.

I like these speakers, I love the light effects available, they are very, VERY cool and look amazing. But I am also very close to replacing them with a set of speakers with a traditional volume know and front-facing headphone jack. It's weird that two small design features like that are shaping my opinion.

The design quality and features of these speakers are incredibly robust and I'm not disappointed with them. I'm also not disappointed with the audio quality overall, but from a practical standpoint they are somewhat problematic simply with the lack of a analog volume control and inconvenient headphone jack location.",2020-07-25T05:35:30,gyrader,Best Buy US,True
214521172,4,"Great speakers, ok software","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First off, holy crap are these speakers loud. But not only loud, they sound great. The bass is powerful but not overwhelming. I also like that it uses USB. It has the option for 3.5mm or bluetooth but I havent tried them. Sound quality gets a 5/5. 

The lighting is awesome. I use the audio visualizer by default, since I listen music whenever I'm not gaming and it's amazing. Syncs to music perfectly. I use the screen sampling while playing certain games and it's insane how well It works and how fast the colors update from the screen. It just works. You have to experience it in person. You can select which games you want to screen sample in specific profiles. Which turn on automatically when you open the game(s) you selected. Certain games have their own profiles for special lighting effects. Like turning red when your health is low. Which is cool. But I dont really play any of the supported games. But I knew that before hand so I didnt care. I mainly got it for the visualizer and screen sampling, and they work great. Lights are bright without being overwhelming. And you can lower them or turn them off if youd like. Screen sampling works fine on my 3440x1440 ultrawide. Would probably be better on a desk against a flat wall as opposed to a corner like mine but they still look awesome. Picture doesnt do justice 

My only gripe with these is the software. Personally, I say dont upgrade the firmware to 122.2.22. The sound quality took a nosedive. Leave it at version 122.1.21. Bass became nearly non existant. Sound quality felt flat. Luckily if you do update, u can downgrade by getting the old firmware installer. That being said, I'm happy with my older firmware. Secondly, there are 2 different software sites to use. Logitech Gaming Software (LGS) and G Hub. Personally, I think G Hub was God awful for setting these up. Overly simplified and far less detailed options to configure the lighting. Creating and editing profiles felt like a chore. Everything just felt hidden in sub menus. LGS had more options it seems, although a little less intuitive. Everything was out in the open. A little messy and overwhelming at first glance, but I like being able to see everything without searching through menus and options. A mixture of the 2 would be perfect. I got the software set up to do what I want, just think it can be improved.

Lastly, I wish the lighting turned off when the pc shuts down, but since they use external power from the wall, the lights stay on until you power them down. Clicking a button isnt the end of the world, but having it turn off automatically would be nice. The software has an option to turn them off after X minutes of no use but It didnt seem to turn off. Or I was being impatient. 

Overall, I love these speakers. Having been on the fence about buying since the released, im actually happy my other speakers died and I gave in and got these. Worth the money and they sound amazing. Lighting is amazing. Far more than a gimmick. Software and firmware issues take 1 star off.

316788136,4,Simplistic and pretty,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Like all Razer products, they excel in their aesthetics. The speaker is beautiful and it's easy to set up, especially if you already own other Razer products. The soundbar comes with two sets of angled feet, allowing you to get the perfect angle for the speaker to face toward you. All settings are modified through the Razer Synapse software and are easily digestible. There's a toggle switch on the soundbar that allows you to switch between your gaming headset or another audio device on the fly without having to go to your Windows sound settings to set the default audio device.

Unfortunately, I found the Leviathan a bit too simplistic, As shown in the photos, the settings provided are all that's available. The only way to adjust the audio settings further is to download the THX Spatial application and modify them through that application instead. However, even after installing the THX Spatial application, I found the Leviathan to be far too bass-heavy. As a disclaimer, I generally love the bass (huge metal and electronic music listener), but for video games like Armored Core, I found the bass to be so blown out, no matter how I modified the equalizer settings. I tried the latest firmware update and adjusting the equalizer, it was either very little bass or far too much. For music, the Leviathan sounds great, but when translated to video games, it falls very short. I think for those who want something better and only have space for a soundbar in their audio setup, I recommend the SoundBlasterX Katana instead. For those who want a plug-and-play, above-average soundbar that matches their Razer setup, look no further than the Leviathan.",2023-09-06T19:40:32,Sean,Best Buy US,True

312027118,4,Perfect case lots of space and cable management,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This case is good with plenty of space except for a few hiccups. I paired this with a 1000w power supply by Corsair but there wasn’t room for that power supply unless I took the hard drive tray out. If you plan to use ssd thought there are three mounting brackets in the back panel that don’t get in the way of anything. Or if you want a blocky hard drive I can still use that just let it sit loose behind the power supply.

Comes with extra Velcro straps and tie downs for it making cable management easy even for a beginner pc builder. Comes with extra Velcro straps which is nice because if you overly tighten them the plastic on the Velcro can come off but they are good quality I’m just a bit rough with my straps so don’t overly tighten them but if you do plenty of extras. Has great airflow too, little shroud on the right vent for fans to redirect air strait over the motherboard is nice so you technically have 6 fans blowing in in one direction making for a chili pc",2023-07-22T17:52:24,Certified,Best Buy US,True

I’m very fond of the door that helps hide cables I’m the back, as well as how customizable the case is. The only thing I’m not super happy with would be the case fans and the controllers associated with it, as they have so many cables and it makes for a super unfun time to manage.

332035946,5,The Cosmic Journey of the Corsair iCUE 5000D RGB A,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Greetings, fellow space travelers. I’m a mom, not Elon Musk, but let’s embark on an interstellar adventure about the Corsair iCUE 5000D RGB AIRFLOW ATX Mid-Tower Case.

The Odyssey Begins:
In a twist of fate worthy of a space odyssey, I purchased a Corsair power supply, grand and mighty, only to discover it was like trying to park a SpaceX rocket in a backyard shed. The solution? The expansive universe of the iCUE 5000D RGB AIRFLOW case.

The Design - A Galactic Marvel:
This case is a black hole of beauty. Its spacious interior is like the vastness of space, easily accommodating the power supply and more. With tempered glass panels, it’s like gazing out of a spacecraft window.

RGB Lighting - The Aurora Borealis of PCs:
The RGB lighting is not just illumination; it’s a cosmic light show. It’s like having the Northern Lights inside your computer, bringing a touch of the cosmos right to your desk.

Airflow - A Breath of Martian Air:
Airflow in this case is like a gentle Martian breeze, ensuring everything stays cool, even when your PC is exploring the computational equivalents of distant galaxies.

A Mom’s Verdict:
As a mom, I’m no rocket scientist, but the Corsair iCUE 5000D makes me feel like I’m in mission control, overseeing a successful space mission. My son’s setup is now not just a PC, but a journey into the frontiers of gaming and computing.",2024-01-13T01:09:53,Bottom,Best Buy US,True

I added a Corsair 360mmm AIO to the front as intake, and moved the three front fans to the top as exhaust, along with adding a fourth case fan to the top back as exhaust.

Thermals are great even under full load (Ryzen 5800X3D, a giant XFX 7900XT), no doubt thanks to the good airflow.

It comes with the hub for fan speed and RGB, but for full control you'll need to download the iCUE software.",2024-05-05T20:26:07,NicholasB,Best Buy US,True

317410071,5,Cosair 5000 D,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair 5000D computer case is a fantastic choice for enthusiasts and gamers alike. Its sleek design and high-quality construction make it a standout option in the crowded PC case market.

First and foremost, the build quality is exceptional. The steel frame feels robust, and the tempered glass side panel provides a clear view of your components while maintaining a premium look. Cable management is a breeze thanks to the ample space behind the motherboard tray and the included cable routing channels.

One of the standout features of the 5000D is its excellent airflow. The front panel features a mesh design that allows for optimal cooling, and it can support multiple fans or even a radiator for liquid cooling. The case also comes with three 120mm fans pre-installed, ensuring your components stay cool even during intense gaming sessions.

The interior layout is spacious and accommodating, with plenty of room for large graphics cards and multiple storage devices. The tool-free drive bays and removable fan trays make installation a straightforward process.

On the downside, the 5000D is quite large, so make sure you have enough space for it in your setup. Additionally, the price point may be a bit high for some budget-conscious users, but the quality and features justify the cost for those seeking a premium case.

In summary, the Corsair 5000D is a top-tier computer case with outstanding build quality, excellent airflow, and a sleek design. It's a fantastic choice for gamers and PC enthusiasts looking to build a high-performance and visually appealing system.",2023-09-12T12:56:41,Sara,Best Buy US,True

264807471,5,A Solid Machine for the Hobbyist Musician,"If you're simply looking for a nice desktop computer for your everyday needs, then this is going to do the job and then some. In terms of using it for work and play-related things, I think of it like driving a Cadillac over a Chevy. This machine will perform most any task with great speed and ease. It's an elegant piece of hardware as well, being entirely self-contained, and the keyboard and Magic Mouse both very comfy to use. The latter two stay charged for nearly a month at a time with daily use. Oh, and the 4K Retina© display is beautiful. I honestly can't imagine the new 5K being any sharper.

I bought this computer brand new in the box one year ago. It's the first Apple product I've ever owned, and I'm impressed. I purchased it with the sole intent of using it for music production. With it, I can run Ableton Live 11 (my DAW of choice) with at least eight tracks of plug-ins and automations, as well as hardware—two MIDI keyboards and a USB interface—before it really starts to use up a lot of the CPU. I can even check out a website or watch a YouTube tutorial while I've got Ableton running, and it still doesn't lock up on me. It's impressive!

While this certainly isn't an optimal computer for music production, housing its modest i5 3.0GHz processor, it's still no slouch! If you're a hobbyist musician like myself, it's just fine. With that said, I'm sure someday—perhaps several years from now—I'll upgrade to a more powerful model, but for now, it's really just fine for my purposes. 

As for being a used PC/laptop type of guy coming into the world of Apple, I have to say that the quality of this machine is really nice. Of course, it's also the most expensive computer I've ever bought, but hey, you get what you pay for!",2021-07-08T11:11:28,Brandon,Best Buy US,True

- I have a total of 13 fans in my case, 6 of which are on a push pull configuration on the Roof. Even with that inches thing block, there is plenty of room to fit the 2x8 cables that plug into the top left of my motherboard. 

- Side fans are awesome as well. You can leave the shroud in to direct air over the motherboard, or take the shroud off and let the air into the case. I opted for removing it, and I average 26-32°C on my H150I XT top radiator coolant. GPU stays cool as well; I don't believe I have gone above 50°C outside of Heaven benchmark since I purchased this case.

- Icue works better than expected, and all of my RGB fans are working together nicely.

From the moment I unboxed it, I was thoroughly impressed with the build quality and design.

First and foremost, the white finish looks absolutely stunning. It adds a touch of elegance and modernity to my gaming setup that I absolutely love. The case feels sturdy and well-built, and it's clear that CORSAIR has paid attention to even the smallest details.

One of the standout features for me is the excellent airflow design. My components stay impressively cool, even during long gaming sessions or demanding tasks. The combination of the front mesh panel and spacious interior ensures that there's plenty of airflow, keeping my system running smoothly.

The RGB lighting is another highlight of this case. It's fully customizable through the iCUE software, allowing me to match it perfectly with the rest of my RGB components. The lighting effects are vibrant and add a captivating ambiance to my gaming rig.

Cable management is a breeze with this case, thanks to the ample space behind the motherboard tray and the well-placed cable routing holes. This keeps my build looking clean and organized, which is something I greatly appreciate.

Overall, the CORSAIR iCUE 5000D RGB AIRFLOW ATX Mid-Tower Case in True White has exceeded my expectations.

Having the proper tools to do the job not only makes it easier and less time consuming, but also FUN! And having the right tools for your PC and electronics is no exception. iFixit has made a quality tool set that is a great value if you decide to start tackling your own electronics repairs. 

It has everything you'll need and then some. The tools are quality made and the bits are hardened so they wont round off. If you manage to round one of these bits, you're using way too much force and its a miracle you haven't broken your device yet.

The spudgers and picks are a hard plastic that is strong but has some flex and will take the damage instead of your device. The reverse metal tweezers are great for holding things together and the suction cup SUCKS like its suppose to and holds your glass screen while you disconnect it.

Everything in this kit screams high quality.

One of the things I appreciate the most about this kit is its universality. It's proven to be a lifesaver whether I'm working on a laptop, a smartphone, a games console or even a drone. The case is also well designed, compact and durable.

I used the tr6 bit to relocate a clip on a knife and after loosening 2 screws there is a noticeable twist at the tip of the bit. I would advise against using any small bit on a tight screw. The material is simply not strong enough to break the screw without distorting the bit.

The three RGB fans on the front not only makes it captivating, but it also provides exceptional airflow for optimal cooling. It is pretty quiet as well, and is a great case for those with pc noise problems. The case provides ample space on the inside as well (depending on your motherboard/ATX size) it can fit Mini-ITX, micro-ATX, ATX, and E-ATX motherboard sizes. The inclusion of a USB-C header and a reboot button are really convenient. The design is undeniably beautiful, with a great tempered glass that lets the RGB light pass through quite well. It's worth noting that some people may need to get a PWM header to use all of the fans, and it's also bigger than it looks. Overall, the Corsair iCue 4000D stands out as an excellent choice for everyone, it is stylish, spacious, and high-performing.

I ended up selecting the MS50A. It doesn’t look out of place in a permanent location but it’s also small enough (weighing about 5 lbs.) that I can easily take it with me when I need to. Wirelessly connecting my phone or PC is simple and fast. As quickly as I could I put the speaker through its paces, playing a wide assortment of songs from: The Rolling Stones, Vivaldi, Tony Bennett, Soundgarden, Prince, Wagner, Cradle of Filth, Johnny Cash, and Lizzo. I was really impressed. It handled everything extremely well. The room-filling sound had rumbly bass, crisp and precise highs, and excellent clarity. No distortion of any kind was detected even at the highest volume. The companion app works well for controlling volume and the like, and switching between devices is quick.

290049369,5,Loving the bass!,"Its extremely rich base is enough for me to give the Edifier - MS50A Bookshelf Speaker’s 5 stars! Makes one remember what good sound used to be before all the echo speakers took over everyone’s houses. 

There is also a very bare bones mobile app you can download for it that does come in handy when ito control the volume when I connect [it] to my portable record player via Bluetooth since the player itself does not have an app to control its volume. Any other time I want to connect to the MS50A, I use its wifi connection from my phone and control it via multiple apps including the Alexa app. As much as I wish it was truly portable to quickly move it around the house , I feel the incredible sound it gives would be lacking to accommodate a rechargeable battery vs a plug. Looks like I will be buying more to place around the house instead…",2022-11-01T21:11:23,jasonclarke1,Best Buy US,True

I haven’t been impressed with the sound quality of echo devices so I decided to try this as an upgrade and the difference is night and day. The sound quality of the Edifier speaker blows the echo devices out of the water.

The cable management space at the back is deep enough to run a lot of cables, even the fat ones.

You can add/ remove particular segments in the casing according to how you want it to look like. (pic attached).

Even though it is glass at the front and top, it still has enough clearing to throw the air out rather than just throwing it right back in. My CPU and GPU temps are normal.",2021-10-25T15:24:24,Moon,Best Buy US,True
261803829,5,Corsair almost got perfect.,"One of Corsair best case out right now. The ability to put thirteen (13th) fans in this case is what sold me. Although, the case only comes with a 6 port to control six fan. Which is okay because if your going all Corsair you'll get more hubs with AIO and 3-packs of RGB (like the LL140). Though if you got extra 60-75 bucks, add a Corsairs Commander Pro to make you life easier on install.

 I was going to put Intel's 11th Gen in the case and heard they ran hot. But after not being able to buy one at release, I went with top 10 tenth (10th) Gen.

The front of the case has plenty of room. Making it easy to mount AIO radiator in four positions. Those being top of case, inside top, side and front. I choose inside top to make push/pull configuration. Also, Guess this is for Water Cooler Pumps or Dolls peps like to put inside. Either way I'll take it.  Who knows maybe I'll get a Doll too. 

The side (back of motherboard) the case is where we all have trouble it seem. Although Corsair has improve this case and made it real slick. Two  (2) more inches here would be nice. Although, it is nice that they provided a door to cover but felt like I squashed wire (just a little) when closing. Also, Power Supply Unit (PSU) is not that easy to install. Make sure to account for bundle wire space. I remove the Hard Drive (HD) bay on bottom to add more space for wire bundles. Corsair if you listening, please add a backplate temple to allow the PSU to slide in from back instead of placing PSU from inside. Makes for easier mount and cable management.

A little pricy for most enthusiast builders but that's cause it is well made. So if you ask me if I had to do build a PC again today. I would still choose this case.",2021-05-31T15:38:56,WFSJR,Best Buy US,True

288363944,5,Freedom to express yourself in your custom build,"This case is amazing. I've had it for almost a year now, and it has been great.  

It's big enough to accommodate a lot of components for a robust build. It's beautiful enough to allow you to express your creativity as well. Swapping parts is easy.

One of my favorite features of this case is the ease of access - it's so easy to take the panels off and access the components or the wires. I love that the back of it hides the wires but still offers easy access.

I did replace all the case fans with Corsair QL fans which I like better (and I did the same on my Elite Capellix too). I also replaced the node controller with lighting node core from one of my QL fan kits.

Here's what I've managed to fit into this case: 

MB:	        ASUS Z590-A Prime
CPU:	Intel Core i7-11700K
GPU:	EVGA GeForce RTX 3070 XC3 ULTRA
M2:	        Samsung 980 PRO 1TB Gen4
SSD:	Samsung 870 QVO 4TB
RAM:	Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL 64GB (4 x 16GB) White
PSU:	Corsair RM850x 80+ Gold White
Cooling:	Corsair H150i ELITE CAPELLIX 360mm White with iCUE ELITE CPU Cooler LCD Display Upgrade Kit  White
Misc:

• V1Tech GPU Backplate with iCue adapter kit 
• Lian Li PW24-V2 ADDRESSABLE RGB STRIMER Plus 24-PIN, white 
• LIAN LI PW8-V2 ADDRESSABLE RGB STRIMER Plus 8-PIN, white 
• Corsair iCUE Commander PRO- Corsair iCUE Lighting Node PRO RGB Lighting Controller with Multicolored light strips 
• upHere 5V Addressable RGB White Graphics Card GPU Brace 
• EZDIY-FAB Adapter Cable for Corsair Lighting Node Pro and for Corsair iCUE Commander PRO - 2 Pack 
• SilverStone Technology Silverstone 8-Port PWM Fan Hub/Splitter

Notes:	
• Replaced case fans and provided node controller with QL fans and one of the lighting node cores from the fan kits (2 fans and 3 lighting node cores are ultimately unused). 
• Replaced the rgb/power hubs that come with case with one of the Lighting Node Cores and Silverstone Hub. 
• Replaced Elite Capellix fans with QL fans. 

Wiring:
• The front and side fans -> Lighting node core. 
• The Lian Li strimers with EZDIY-FAB adapter -> Commander Pro (set as 2 QL fans in iCUE). 
• The Corsair RGB strips -> Commander Pro (set as 4 RGB LED strips in iCUE). 
• The upHere GPU brace with EZDIY-FAB adapter -> Lighting Node Pro (set as 1 RGB LED strip in iCUE). 
• V1Tech GPU backplate with iCUE adapter -> Lighting Node Pro (set as 2 RGB LED strips in iCUE). 
• Rear fan -> Elite Cappelix controller.

With the above wiring I was able to get everything controlled by iCUE (even the non-Corsair items).",2022-10-15T20:12:01,Linda,Best Buy US,True
328899131,5,THX spatial sound is so worth it,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Nommo V2 X are some impressive gaming speakers that help to engulf me in sound.  The speakers are ideal for a gamers desk for times when you're not using your headphones.  The audio that these speakers deliver is big for their relatively smaller size.

The gaming speakers consist of 3 inch full range drivers.  These offer up a nice clarity and full range of sound and audio.  I like the sound quality for gaming, listening to music, and streaming movies/shows.  Excellent depth of sound.  These speakers are fantastic for me because I love the THX Spatial Audio feature.  There is a required software for Razer to be installed to utilize this feature.  THX Spatial Audio offers a virtual 7.1 surround sound that you can really hear and feel.  The Razer program allows you to switch back and forth between the standard sound and THX sound, and the difference is distinctly noticeable.  I love playing my FPS games with this as it truly makes the shots sound like they're moving right past you from every direction.  The sound can be customized to your liking with THX Game Profiles built into the software.  Ideal for the user that wants to have the most relevant sound for his/her ear.

I like the fact that this set of gaming speakers can be used with USB connection or with Bluetooth capability.  Having the flexibility of Bluetooth is a nice feature, so I can still use them for playing music through my iPhone as well.  The speakers are ready to use right out of the box, with plug and play functionality.  They are stationary speakers that don't allow for any movement such as tilting or swiveling the speakers from the base footprint.  Physical buttons on top make it easy to operate including a power/pair button, volume up, and volume down.  The green light shows that it's powered and connected with a hardwire audio, and the blue light shows that it's paired up via Bluetooth.  The Razer Nommo V2 X offers a maximum sound pressure of 96dB which is plenty of sound that can pump through these.  Rear facing bass ports allow for a nice little bounce off the nearby wall.  The speakers are great to look at and offer a nice range of sound throughout the volume levels.

THX spatial audio is impressive

328756798,4,Good sound but not what I expected.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like the Razer products that I have purchased over the last couple of years and had high expectations on what the Nommo V2 speakers would sound like. 




I was impressed with the aesthetic look of the speakers when I unboxed them and liked the outstanding craftmanship in the materials they used on them. I got the speakers to replace an old sound system I stopped using a long time ago and quickly noticed the lack of bass in the sound of the speakers. I was glad that I could adjust the settings via the equalizer for them but was still disappointed overall. 




I am glad that they came up with the option for Bluetooth pairing instead of just USB connections. I also like the THX spatial audio 7.1 surround sound feature of the speakers which helped make up for the disappointments. 


I am glad I still got the speakers though since it is nice to not have to wear earbuds all the time and have some more powerful audio coming out of the Nommo V2’s instead of just my system speakers.

They are loud,clear and high quality. Definitely a great purchase if you want an amazing sounding speaker. The Razer Nommo speakers use a THX audio which is great for gaming since it allows for games to have a clearer and better sense of space in competitive games. The razer app is useful for those who want to customize the speakers and allow them to switch the speakers from wired connection to a bluetooth, which is fascinating since you can use them for things other than PC like consoles , phone or TV. The speakers are easy to setup. They come with a USB cable connecting both of them to the computer, and the power cable connecting it to an outlet.  The speakers are spectacular and they create an immersive experience in games. The speakers look nice and sleek on the desk and they don't have rgb, for me this is great since I don't really like having it.The audio is great for gaming and definitely a great decision for gamers who are on a budget but want a decent speaker for gaming.

328267911,5,I love 'em and they sound fantastic to me!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TL;DR, The Razer Nommo V2s for me at least, had a significant upgrade to the sound quality to what I was using and I am so happy with the clarity improvements, bass improvements, and ""surround sound"" improvements. 

Long story long, these speakers made my PC listening experience so much better. Setup was super easy and simple. It needed power, a USB connection to your PC and a cord to the left speaker. Done. After a few, Razer Synapse pops up asking to be installed.

At first I opted out of the Razer Synapse software, I didn't see how it would enhance my experience, but installed it anyway a couple days later and there was a firmware update to the speakers. In addition to that there were some quality of life improvements with the software too. So I'm very glad I chose to install the software. I like the app specific sound profiles, pretty neat. The ability to swap audio devices by pressing both buttons on the speaker is also pretty neat, especially when I wanna wear my headsets instead and forget to switch it during gameplay. This is a super nice little feature that makes life so much easier. 

There are some pre-existing sound profiles and to my ear, music sounds the best for well music lol. Offering the right amount of bass and vocal clarity for music. Using the Netflix app on Windows to test out surround and audio profiles, I found that Movie sounded the best, ironically for movies and shows however the differences were more subtle depending on the scene. For example in an anime, if there was no music playing I couldn’t really hear a difference unless I’m really trying to pick one out, and if there was an action scene, I felt like Movie gave me the most impact on the sound as well. And lastly while gaming, movie, music, and default sounded the best. The Gaming EQ preset was just not doing it for me. 

I ran the same test again but with THX on and I don’t know why, but it sounds funky to me. In movies and games there’s some improvement, but for music, I just don’t like it. Ultimately though I left it on the Music with THX on because profile switching was inconvenient and it could cover most of what I wanted and creating automatic game and app/program profiles for specific content. So for Netflix, it uses the Movie profile, and for some games I care about it does too. But everything else defaults to the Music which is fine for me. 

As for the build quality it’s great, I like the low profile of the speakers and how they’re upward facing, the feel nice and the rubber feet are quality and don’t slide around all over the place. 

At the end of the day, these are fantastic for my use case and I highly recommend them to anyone.",2023-12-22T03:42:06,GamingBusinessGuy,Best Buy US,False
328470219,5,Powerful Simple Speakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’d say I’m overall a fan of Razer products, but I wouldn’t normally look towards Razer for a desktop speaker system.  But when the old USB speakers bit the dust on my girlfriend’s setup, I decided to give the Razer Nommo V2 a try!  The main appeal for the Razer Nommo V2 was it paired well with the Razer Mouse and Keyboard her setup already had, which ment the software was already installed to use the speakers.

Pros:
- Easy to setup and Use.
- Loud!
- Configurable EQ settings.

Cons:
- Large for desktop speakers!
- Requires Razer Software to work.

First impressions are just how large these speakers are, the pictures don’t do them justice as the screen must be a 32in or greater in the pictures!  Rough dimensions are about 5in circular base with a height of 7.25in, the speakers themselves are about 5.25in circular and 5.75in long.  For perspective, these were replacing the generic block speakers that were 3in wide by 3in length by 4.5in in height.  A big upgrade to say, but still Nommo V2 still fit right under the main monitor on a monitor arm.

Setup was a breeze, simply plug in then follow the setup guide in Razer Synapse. The Right speaker has all the plugins and control buttons: Plug for Left speaker, USB-C PC connection, and Power.  The 3 control buttons are located on top: Power On, Volume Up and Down.  Power on the speakers then follow the Synapse setup steps.  In my case, there were 2 updates required: Synapse required an update and the Nommo speakers had a hardware update.  This did require a system restart to apply.  Overall, setup took less than 10 minutes.  Adding additional devices via Bluetooth was easy, though beyond a phone being connected we will mainly use the USB-C connection.  

The Razer Nommo V2 speakers sound clear and are powerful for desktop speakers.  You could easily use the Nommo V2 in a media PC setup and sit back from your desk while still hearing your audio without issue.  Sitting at a desk setup in front of the speakers, We only needed to set the volume to 10 if the audio was quiet, otherwise for most media we left it at 6.  The only negative about the speaker system is that the Bass is lacking.  If you want to have that powerful boom, you’d want to get the 3-piece set with the separate Sub-Woofer as the Bass on the two side speakers is very weak.  Otherwise, this is a perfect desktop speaker.  The EQ settings are great, easy to use with some preset defaults that make a big difference.  The movie setting helped bring out the voices while watching movies or YouTube, which will be the main use for the speakers.  

I would recommend adjusting the default Power settings, as out of the box the settings turn the speakers off after 15mins of no use.  I set it to never turn off, as there will be a lot of switching between sources and having to turn the speakers on after each switch will become an annoyance.

Overall, the Razer Nommo V2 is a powerful simple speaker system.  I’d recommend these mainly for gamers who already use Razer products and only need some light use speakers without a concern for powerful Bass.  The biggest limitation of these speakers is the requirement for the Razer Synapse software on setup, but the software is simple to use and enhances the speakers in all the right ways.",2023-12-17T19:09:03,BradfordBT,Best Buy US,False
328872675,4,"Quality, great sound, but still lacking.","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Usually, I expect to have lots of talking points for a product review. With the Razer Nommo V2 X speakers though, this review is a little more cut and dry. The Nommo V2 X speakers are a cut-down version of the Nommo V2 Pro. Compared to the V2 Pro, this product does not have a wireless subwoofer or wireless remote for controlling your audio. Is that a bad thing? It depends on your needs, and after testing these speakers for a few days, I have plenty of thoughts to share.


DESIGN


Razer has been very consistent over the past few years with their new design philosophy. Gone are the days of “Look at me, I’m green!”, and now, many of Razer’s products are matte black, sleek, and will fit in with almost any setup.  The speakers themselves look sharp, really sharp. They’re simple, modern, and I like the formfactor. From Razer’s perspective, I’m sure the speakers are shaped how they are because of how the drivers are stacked internally. And for those who were wondering – the base of the speakers is solid, you won’t see these speakers wobbling around or falling over on your desk. The dimensions of each speaker are 130 mm (W) x 184 mm (H) x 180 mm (D). Honestly, the speakers are unexpectedly large, hefty, weighty, and you will be surprised by the size of them when you take them out of the box! To say they feel premium would be an understatement, the speakers have a truly solid build.


AUDIO


In a word: Impressive. For stereo PC speakers, I can’t expect much more than what’s been given here. The audio is clean – I don’t experience distortion when switching from a very low volume to a high volume and this is one of my favorite tell-tale signs of quality when testing PC speakers. Razer passed the quality test here.

For my music testing, I kept it diverse. I tested with some hardcore music (Dance Gavin Dance), a bit of rap (Trippie Redd), some lo-fi beats, and some SZA. Overall, everything sounded beautiful. The clarity is there, the whole way through, with every song I tested. Where things get weird is testing the bass. You’ll be disappointed in the bass – and when I say that, I don’t mean the bass performance is terrible. For a set of stereo speakers, the bass is clean, crisp, and well mixed. However, for anyone who is used to having more bass from their current headphones, soundbar, car audio, etc., you might feel a bit disappointed. If you have a need for bassy audio, you’re looking for the Razer Nommo V2 Pro, which includes a nice wireless subwoofer.

For gaming, I spent my time playing Cyberpunk 2077, Overwatch 2, and CS:GO. Again, the audio quality is great, and these speakers provide an immersive experience in any game you prefer. Since these speakers are focused on creating an immersive gaming experience, and THX Spatial Audio is one of the main features of these speakers, I believe it’s important to look at how THX Spatial Audio changes the gaming experience. With that said…


FEATURES


For anyone who hasn’t used THX Spatial Audio on a Razer product, I’m a fan of it. Keep in mind that THX Spatial Audio is used to create a virtual 7.1 surround sound setup. Does it work? Sure, absolutely, but most folks will not gain a performance advantage when using stereo vs. THX Spatial Surround in most video game titles. I enjoy using THX audio when I’m listening to music as it creates a broader soundstage, which lets you catch more of the nuance in your favorite songs. I think that’s a killer feature for any PC speaker. For gaming though, I fully expect that stereo sound will be just as good as THX Spatial Audio. If we were talking about gaming headsets, I’d have a different opinion here, but a stereo pair of PC speakers will always have difficulty creating 7.1 virtual channels of sound.

Razer also packed in Bluetooth 5.0 with these speakers, which adds some much-needed versatility to the Nommo V2 X. For one reason or another, Razer believes that USB C is the only interface needed to hook up these speakers to a sound source. I would love to see a 3.5mm jack added to the back of these speakers, it would really make these speakers all the more functional. The only reason I feel understanding about this is because these are gamer focus PC speakers… On the flip side though, Razer is hoping that Playstation and Nintendo Switch owners will be utilizing these speakers, so if they’re trying to reach a broader audience – more than PC gamers – they should’ve included the 3.5mm jack.


SOFTWARE


Razer Synapse will automatically try to install and launch when you plug these speakers into your PC. I’m torn about this though. I appreciate Razer trying to streamline setup for their users, but as someone with an IT background, having random things open on your personal computer feels bad.
I use Razer Synapse to manage my other Razer products (Gaming headset and mouse) and I don’t have any complaints about the software itself. In the context of these speakers, it’s a simple interface for changing your EQ presets and/or levels, as well as enabling/disabling THX Spatial Audio.

Important Note: In Synapse, when you’re looking at the settings for the Nommo V2 X speakers, be sure to visit the “Power” tab and set the speakers to never automatically turn off. I can’t imagine many people enjoy manually powering on their PC speakers after they sit down at their desk!


FINAL THOUGHTS


It’s a great product, I think it’s worth taking a look at for anyone who wants a versatile set of stereo speakers. However, I think most gamers will prefer having a headset, and most speaker owners will prefer to have a subwoofer (or just more bass) and a 3.5mm jack to hook these speakers up to any audio source. While I do think this is a great product, it’s clear that there are a few things dragging it down as well.",2023-12-20T18:46:28,Curtis,Best Buy US,False
328678088,4,Good speakers but lacks bass,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was not expecting much with the Razer Nommo because it didn’t come with a subwoofer. But when I powered them on, I was surprised at what I heard. The speakers get fairly loud, and the music comes out clear. I was also surprised by the physical size of the speakers. They are fairly large and have some weight on them. It has a power button and volume control. 

It comes with a power adapter for US and Australian/New Zealand outlets (according to the diagram in the manual). You can plug it in via USB or Bluetooth. It comes with USB-A to USB-C cable. I am using it with my MacBook Pro M3 Max. I could not use the included USB cables because the Macbook only has USB-C ports. I used a different cable and works great. RMS Power is rated at 8W, it would be great if it could be powered by USB – less cables but I tried and the speakers powered off. 

Because it does not have a subwoofer do not expect it to have a lot of bass. It is still good speakers though for what it can do. Good for PC gaming and music. If you like bass, get the version with a subwoofer.",2023-12-19T05:14:04,sherwinmdev,Best Buy US,False
328135284,4,"Great clarity with EQ, lacks bass. Some caveats.","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Appealing looks? THX Spatial imagining? Bluetooth? Check. Check. Check.

Anyway let's go right into it..

SOUND:

This is weird to say, but I'm actually both disappointed and amazed at how these speakers reproduce audio.

The pros? The clarity is actually really amazing when slightly EQ'd. The speakers can punch at or above their weight class. The cons? There is an obvious lack of bass reproduction. The only thing I can think of is that the speakers were re-purposed from the PRO version and lack that overall subwoofer oomph for all types of music. If you're listening to classic rock, these sound quite nice. Hip hop? You may want to look elsewhere. 

3/5

BUILD QUALITY AND APPEARANCE:

The exterior build quality and subjective look of these speakers are absolutely phenomenal. It's clear that Razer has evolved over the years and is very involved in making the industrial design stand out. They look like a hybrid between a studio monitor and legacy gaming speaker setup.

I absolutely have no complaints.. 5/5

CONTROLS/USB/BT:

There is a physical on/off button and volume +/- control on right side of the device.

Digital Audio is handled by an internal DAC inside the right speaker itself. The chip can transmit to both USB and Bluetooth depending on what you prefer.. Both connection types work amazingly well without issues from my 3-4 days of testing.

Mostly problem free, but I did run into one annoyance of the speakers powering down when the PC decides to sleep.  This means you have to hit the power button on the speakers every time you resume windows. 

4/5. 

SOFTWARE:

The Nommo V2 X uses Razer Synapse. This is required if you want to use the speakers with THX Spatial sound. I'm not particularly found of THX, but it does add immersion into games like GTA 5 or CP77 from my brief testing with games.

The other portion of the software is just an EQ tab.. There are standard presets with the optional custom fader.

4/5.. Lack of Software settings? If that bothers you at least.


OVERALL:

I'm pretty content using these as my main gaming speakers when not using headphones.. Just wish there was more bass extension to round out the overall experience.

The best way to explain it? It sounds like a soundbar without its dedicated subwoofer.  A standard pair of USB studio monitors might be a better option for some people, but you likely wont have THX functionally going that route.

328601973,5,These Speakers are Beast!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have many Razer products. I've used various computer gaming peripherals for quite a long time. Rarely has any device failed to perform to my expectations. With regards these Razer Nommo v2 X speakers, I wasn't sure what to expect as I'd never owned any of their brand of speakers. However, after giving these a try, 'color me impressed'!

While this set of speakers are rather huge, they kinda need to be in order to be able to put out the level of audio quality they do. Besides which, they are really modern looking, sleek and stylish too, and should compliment any gamer's setup.

Although I already had Razer's PC software, and the simple startup guide explained how to connect the speakers fairly well, I did have some issues at first. Once I took a breath, read over the instructions (one more time), updated the firmware from Razer's support page, and began again, all was well and the speakers worked as intended. Sometimes you just gotta take a minute and start over.

The sound quality of these Nommo speakers is phenomenal. Audio output is clear, strong, and smooth; with no crackling or ""hollow"" sounding unpleasantness. If anything, the bass is slightly underwhelming, but I'm not a big fan of deep, loud, bass undertones in my audio - be it music, or when playing video games. As for the THX Spacial Audio, I'm still 'fine tuning' and trying out different speaker positions in my gaming setup to make the most of that feature.

I sorta wish the speakers could be ""tilted"" but that's a preference issue; no big deal breaker or anything. The cords are thick, strong, and more than long enough to reach where you need them. The base, or stand, is very very sturdy, so these speakers will sit securely on your desk or whatever surface you place them upon.

My overall impression so far ... these Razer Nommo v2 X speakers are good stuff! Plus, the price is fair for how well they are built, and the level of audio performance they provide.",2023-12-18T18:26:49,Janine,Best Buy US,False

262197456,5,An electronic showcase,"This case is really a display case which presents the electronic beauty of a computer build. Behind the tinted tempered glass the build is seen with unsightly wiring hidden behind panels. The cable management system in the rear is very good. Cable accommodations with the HDD cage in place and a 180mm PSU are tight. The cage must be moved all the way to the left. The case is rated to take a 220mm PSU but I think the HDD cage would have to go. The spacious front interior is easily ventilated and it invites an emphasis on RGB lighting. It comes with a iCUE lighting node core module for lighting for the 3 fans, but not fan speed control. Fan speed control requires a Commander Core and fans that support speed control. I don't believe that the fans that come with the case do support remote speed control, but the fans with the iCUE H150i Elite Capellix liquid cooler certainly do as do the QL 120 RBG fans I also installed. One of the original case fans did have to be sent to Corsair RMA because it made a tapping sound, and I am waiting for the return. Other than that all the fans are ultra quiet and can barely be heard. 

Everything fits together so precisely. Once learned how. the side panels are removed and reattached very easily. They snap in place and are secured by thumb screws that don't fall off, they stay with the panel. One downside of the panels is that they are glass and do require some careful handling. However Corsair does sell replacements. There are so many thoughtful touches with this case. A removable door opens to reveal the wiring. The filters are easily removed for cleaning. 

This case is a large midsize and I think Corsair should think about carrying this design over to a full size case. This is a wonderful PC case and I think Corsair hit a homerun with it and the entire 5000 line.",2021-06-05T04:24:34,DaveTheBraveUSA,Best Buy US,True

Keep in mind the equipment does take a good amount of space if you have a small set up. 
Pros
-	Matte/Clean Finish
-	Amazing Sound
-	Customizable 
-	Easy volume control with the hub
Cons
-	Big Shells and subwoofer
-	A lot of Cables
Nitpicks
-	Not as small as I thought they would be 
-	Very large subwoofer
-	Cable management can be a bit annoying to deal with
Here is a more detail review of the Razer Nommo V2 2.1 system with 2 speakers and a subwoofer.
Let me start by saying the speakers sound amazing, the sound customizability through the software is very easy to set up which is the most important feature to me. RGB customizability can be a little tedious to learn but I just left mine default since Im not too worried about RBG. Anyways in the box, you end up getting your speakers, subwoofer, volume control hub, cables, and manual. Everything is well packaged and labeled together, and one would not have to worry about shipping incidents or step up. The speakers themselves feel very solid with a metal base and plastic shell that give a nice weight to them. They do have a frosted back piece in the back which is the diffuser for the RGB. The subwoofer is around 1x1x1 ft in size and once plugged in does deliver a nice punch.
My first nitpick would have to be the size of the speakers, which is that they are somewhat on the bigger size. Do not get me wrong they do look amazing, but they would probably look better in a set up with floating monitors or one big curved monitor. On my set up, they ended up barely fitting in the back since I do have 3 monitors on stands. I do understand that they have drivers with amazing technology which require space, and I would have to admit I should have done more research on the size before.  My second nitpick would have to be the size of the subwoofer. I placed it under my desk since I barely have any space close to my tower. In terms of scale, my desk is about 5+ ft long and around 3 ft in depth, and the subwoofer does take a bit of space under. My third and last nitpick would have to be the cable management. The speaker that manages everything is the right speaker, and all the plugs are on that speaker. Once again, I do understand that due to the drivers on these speakers, they need to draw more power so there is one extra cable with a BIG power brick that takes up a lot of space on the wall or wherever it is being plugged in at. The speakers get the audio signal through USB C that connects from the PC to the speaker. Lastly the cable that connects both speakers is something similar to a Mac Serial connector that is very thick and barely reached the other end of my desk. 
Overall sound is amazing, if you watch movies, listen to music, create content or like to play without headphones these speakers are for you. Just keep in mind you might have to tradeoff some space for that crispy sound. Personally, I do like to consume my entertainment on the big screen instead of my PC, but that is just my personal preference. If you have enough space, I would definitely recommend these speakers.",2023-12-21T17:33:20,xupr4,Best Buy US,False
331790029,5,Very good performance and great design!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Two speakers and one subwoofer may not seem to be enough or may not seem to be the most impressive set up, something I thought at first but later realized I was wrong.
This 2.1 full range audio system has impressed me and exceeded my expectations.

In the box is very well packaged and protected the two speakers and the subwoofer as well as the power and USB cables. This model is wired so you have to connect the speakers to the subwoofer, the subwoofer to the pc (or console depending on the case), and the power cable to the subwoofer. When connecting to the PC it is important to download the Razer Synapse app to be able to update the firmware of the device. The app also allows you to configure the sound, select and edit different equalizer presets, configure the RGB light and wireless power saving.

The connection is simple, although it must be considered that it will be necessary to have a good cable management because it is a wired device. The configuration from the app is also simple.

On the right speaker are located the volume buttons and the power button, the power button is the one used to switch the connection from PC to Bluetooth and also to activate the pairing mode to connect to a device wirelessly. On the back of the speakers there is only the cable that is connected to the subwoofer and the RGB light, there are no other connections or extra ports. The speakers have a cylindrical design supported by a circular base, the material the speakers are made of has a matte finish that I personally like a lot. 

The subwoofer is relatively small, although sufficient space is required for installation. The connections are on the back, on the sides and front there is nothing, and at the top only the brand logo printed discreetly and in relief, and like the speakers its finish is matte which makes it look very good.

Regarding the performance I can say that Razer has put time into this, the truth is that the sound quality is very good and even though I have the speakers on my right and left side, the sound seems to come from different points, something that helps a lot when playing video games. Although the titles that are compatible with THX spatial audio are not many, those that do, such as Cyberpunk 2077, offer a very pleasant experience, there is certainly a difference, it is like more ambient sound. In other games I haven't had the need to use my headphones to hear well the environment or other players, it is a very clear sound and I can easily identify where it comes from. In content playback, whether movies, music, series etc, the sound is still clear and strong, it becomes a more immersive experience without a doubt. This added to the subwoofer that has power and makes the room vibrate, is an excellent combination. 

In summary, this set of speakers and subwoofer Razer Nommo V2 has enough power and clarity in the sound either in video games or when consuming multimedia content, it is easy to connect and configure, has a very useful app and has a relatively affordable price, also at the end of January razer will launch its Wireless Control Pod that will make the experience even more enjoyable, a well-made product that I can certainly recommend.",2024-01-11T07:18:02,Serv,Best Buy US,False
331649334,4,Great performers - at a price...,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] True to the Razer name, these computer speakers play the part. They have a distinct design, without being too over the top, well built, and sound terrific. The biggest drawback is the cost. These are pricey speakers. If you have the budget, I highly recommend them. 

IN THE BOX AND SETTING UP
The packaging is, like most Razer things, put together very well. Everything is nicely wrapped and protected. You’ll find a “getting started” guide on the top of the box. The only real thing you need to know - they are speakers after all - is how to put them in Bluetooth pairing mode. Inside you’ll find the two speakers shaped like large cans, a subwoofer, power cable, and USB-C to USB-A cable. It’s pretty self explanatory as there’s only one way everything plugs in, but the cables coming from the two speakers (which are built in) plug into the subwoofer. The plugs are similar to old VGA cables where you have to turn the screws on either side. At first blush it seemed a little unnecessary, but it actually feels like a smart design choice as there’s no chance the cables are falling out without some intentional act.

I didn’t measure the length of the cables, but they should be plenty long for most computer desks. You will, however, need to make sure your desk has plenty of space as these speakers are large. Once they’re in the right place, run the cables from the speakers to the sub. Plug the power cord into the subwoofer, and last, plug the USB into the subwoofer and then into your computer. Voila, that’s it. 

DESIGN
Razer is always known for its flare and RGB lights. And these speakers are no exception. The subwoofer looks like a subwoofer. The feet are long enough to keep the subwoofer an inch or so off the ground, and the feet are made of rubber, so they won’t slide around on hardwood floors. The subwoofer is light and brings with it a 5.5 inch downward facing driver. The speakers look like large cylinders, like large soda cans, that lay on their side and face upwards. They each have 3 inch drivers that provide plenty of power. I think design is a personal preference, but I think most people would like the way these speakers look. They’re not your boxy standing rectangle, but something different that isn’t too “out there.” I will note, however, that the angle of the speakers can’t be adjusted. Basically the speaker is “glued” if you will to the stand. 

The RGB lights. I’m a big fan of RGB lights for my gaming setup - whether it’s my TV or computer. I don’t always have them syncing to the content, I just like the subtle color and pop these lights bring to help your rug/system (whatever) stand out. Here, the lights are built into the back of each speaker. When you look on the backside of the speaker you’ll see a white plastic dome. When you turn the speakers on they’ll light up. The colors are not so bright as to cause any type of disruption - IMO - and create just a nice ambiance no matter what you’re doing. 

The controls are buttons on the top of the right speaker. There’s a power button and volume rocker, that’s it. They obviously speak for themselves. Any other settings, like EQ or lighting must be tweaked in the Synapse app. Honestly, it’s all you need and nothing you don’t. I love the minimalist and simple design of the buttons. They’re large and can’t be missed.

SOUND QUALITY
This is where these bad boys shine. I’ve played Call of Duty, Anno 1886, watched movies, listened to music, and other day to day computer tasks, and all of them sound phenomenal. In fact, the speakers might be too powerful. When cranking up the volume you can literally feel the bass. It’s sharp and crisp without drowning out the details. You can feel explosions in games and listening to music is an absolute treat. It's a true high fidelity sound. But I will caution that some types of music don’t sound the best (when I say that, I mean I still think it sounds pretty good) like the high notes of vocals that can get muddled into the sound. For the most part however, and especially with bass heavy tracks, the speakers will bump. 

When using a PC, you can activate THX Spatial Audio (which would otherwise cost money) to enrich the experience even further. I was flat out amazed at the details and spatial audio of hearing enemies approach me from the side (off screen). It really sounded like true surround sound. NOTE that not all games are THX certified but they still sounded really good. Granted, this is single person use when the speakers are facing you - I’m not suggesting these speakers could replace the surround sound speakers in your living room. 

SYNAPSE SOFTWARE
If you’re new to Razer, you haven’t met the difficulties of navigating/figuring out the Synapse app. It’s a computer app that allows you to adjust the EQ of your speakers or the lights. In fact, it’s supposed to manage all of your Razer peripherals. For me, I find it to quirky and challenging to really do a deep dive into and use on a regular basis. I downloaded it, and once I got the speakers the way I wanted (the only thing I changed was the lighting) I never opened it again. But if you were changing the lights, you go into Synapse to adjust the rear-projection RGB lighting. There are two zone, one for each speaker. You can pick whatever two colors (or the same) you’d like, or you can turn on ambient awareness mode to reflect the area of your screen.

QUIRKS
I’ve never found a perfect product, and these speakers are no exception. There are a few quirks I found. One pertains to the lighting. The lights are on the back of the speaker, so unless you have a wall behind your speaker, you won’t see the lights (they need to reflect off something). I had trouble putting it into Bluetooth mode, so much so that I gave up. For me, this wasn’t really a problem, I just wanted to test it. But if you were relying on this to run music through another device like your phone, just note that I found it to be a difficult process. (you’re supposed to double tap the power button to put it into pairing, I was able to do that and find it on my phone, I just never got it to actually connect and play music).

The next and probably my biggest gripe is that the speakers turn off after inactivity (that’s ok) but don’t turn on when I turn my computer on. Some might say this is a minor annoyance (it is) but I always forget to turn my speakers on when turning my computer on. But each and every time you turn your computer on, you’ll have to turn the speakers on as well. It’s only one button, but I wish they turned on when my desktop did. 

Finally, my only other comment, it’s not really a gripe, but something I want to emphasize for anyone thinking about buying these, is the size of the speakers. Maybe I’m in the minority, but they seem large. When looking at these, make sure you have the desk space to place them. And to that same effect, give some consideration as to what will be behind your speakers like a wall to reflect the RGB lighting. While I don’t think anyone would buy these for the RGB lighting effects alone, why spend the premium on them if you can’t see the lighting reflections behind the speakers?

All in all, these are well built, sharp looking speakers that do well at most anything you would do on your computer -  but they are pricey. I don’t think they’re the best value proposition, but if you have the dough or are invested in the Razer ecosystem, these should be towards the top of your wish list.",2024-01-10T02:15:34,callmeageeth,Best Buy US,False
330109856,5,What Greatness Sounds Like...,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Nommo V2 2.1 full range speakers are a great combination of good looking and great sounding speakers. The cylinder design of the speakers offers a unique look akin to a spotlight which is fitting because the back of the speaker houses full blown RGB lights that have many different effects. You can keep the light static or cycle through colors or patterns as well as react to the sounds that are coming from the speakers. The sound of the speakers is very full, and you hear nice little details such as footsteps or music notes that you may not have heard before using other speakers. Be sure to adjust your subwoofer to your liking as it can be a little “boomy” at the higher settings for my taste. The speakers were wonderfully packaged, and it did feel like you are unpacking a high-quality item. There is one thing that I would change about these speakers, which is that they are not adjustable physically. They cannot be rotated, and the stand cannot be removed so you can mount them somewhere else, maybe the long form factor prevented them doing this but not everyone has a nice flat surface or the desk space to place these giant speakers so it would be nice to have options. All in all, the Razer Nommo V2’s are a great set of speakers that look awesome and sound great, and I would recommend them to anyone that wants speakers that do more than just sound good.",2023-12-29T20:43:14,elzeus,Best Buy US,False
329702259,5,Pleasantly surprised,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So I really, really like these speakers. I used to think Razer was just a hype machine and their hardware was just okay. Well, the last batch of hardware I have gotten my hands on are excellent.

The Nommo V2 speakers are pretty good. I especially like the wireless subwoofer. If you are tight on space this neat feature will let you put the woofer anywhere in your room so that your not tethered to the usual space below your desk. The connection options are a nice touch. Bluetooth and USB are slick and that little puck controller is a nice touch. I haven't been able to get the puck and the Razer Audio app to play nice with each other yet but connecting my phone and the speakers was easy enough.

THX spatial audio is interesting. Not a fan but maybe you will like it. If you are a fan of RGB then you are definitely going to love these speakers. I recommend downloading the Chroma Software and you'll spend hours just trying to get the correct ""ambiance"" for your gaming battlestation.

Overall these are good looking speakers and they sound pretty good as well. I would recommend picking these up if you are already in the Razer ecosystem. If you aren't I would still give them a listen.",2023-12-27T05:09:30,Malcolm,Best Buy US,False

One thing i know from speakers i have owned if it has the razer logo on it well you have an awesome quality great sounding set of speakers, actually my whole setup from my speakers to my mouse and mose matt are razer products. The set of speakers you are doing research for the Razor Nommo V2 are no exception. They are one of the best set of speakers i have ever owned. The sound is crisp with some great punch in the subwoofer. Setup was a breeze. Literally all i did was hook them up and the razer software did the rest. The setting to change the EQ or lighting are rite in front of you so very easy to find and navigate. Also another nice feature with the RGB lighting is there are pre set lighting settings for some of the games you probably own. For instance i play Diablo 4 and world of tanks and all i have to do is select what game i am playing and it will adjust the lighting to fir the game i am playing. So if you are looking for a set of awesome sounding awesome quality speakers look no further. These are by far the best speakers i have ever owned.",2024-01-16T14:38:06,Jeff,Best Buy US,False
332530195,5,"Powerful, Sleek and Easy Sound for your PC","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Nommo V2 2.1 PC Gaming Speakers are a wonderful option for anyone looking for a high-quality audio experience on their PC. They feature a sleek design, powerful sound, and easy setup, but there are some caveats, so let’s get into it!

The speakers are made of a durable black plastic material that seems to be pretty solid. The speakers are a bit big, so make sure you’re accounting for the measurements when choosing them. If you have a smaller desk they may be a bit too big. The subwoofer is massive for a 2.1 PC speaker system, but that’s for a good reason.

The Nommo V2 speakers have a powerful sound and thumpy bass that will easily fill a large room with great sound. They produce clear, detailed sound with a good amount of bass. The speakers also have a wide soundstage with their THX Spatial Sound so that you can enjoy your music, movies, or games in a whole new way.

Volume and power buttons are on top of the right speaker and easily accessible through your Windows volume mixer as well. All the music I tested, from rap to rock and even folk and country sounded fantastic on this speaker set. The highs and mids were crystal clear, while the bass was very thumpy. If you find the bass to be a little overbearing, please set the bass output a little lower in the Synapse app.

Gaming on the Nommos was a great experience too. Guns in Doom sound punchy, footsteps in Call of Duty are heard clearly and ambient audio effects come through very well. Using THX Spatial Sound, available in the Synapse app makes everything come to life even further in games but at the lack of some positional accuracy. I wouldn’t recommend playing a competitive shooter with THX on as sometimes sounds sounded like they were coming from the wrong location.

I don’t always enjoy virtualized surround sound like Dolby Atmos or Windows Sonic, but the THX Spatial Sound in these Nommo speakers is quite good. While I wouldn’t recommend it for multiplayer games where positioning is important, for anything else such as music or movies, the option enhances the sound and makes it feel much wider than it is.

The Nommo V2 speakers are pretty easy to set up as well. You’re simply plugging the subwoofer into an outlet, running both connectors from the speakers to the subwoofer, and then connecting the subwoofer to your PC via USB. They’ll show up as a separate audio device and you’ll be able to control them via the Synapse application in Windows. Double tapping the power button will also allow you to put the speakers into Bluetooth-only mode and pair your phone or other capable device to it.

The Synapse app is pretty easy to use and will allow you to control the volume, bass output, and lighting from the application. The speakers emit soft RGB lighting through the rear that lights up a corner or small space. Don’t expect them to light up a whole room, but instead, add a little ambiance to your desk.

One downside to the Nommo V2 is the lack of a headphone jack on the speakers themselves or a volume knob like in the Pro model. I can’t hold the lack of those features against the device too harshly as they excel in just about every other area.

Overall, the Nommo V2s 2.1 gaming speakers are a great, if not pricier choice for PC gamers and audio lovers. If you don’t need a headphone jack on the speakers themselves and don’t mind the omission of the wireless volume control knob that comes with the Pro model, then these might just be the best speakers you’ve ever connected to a computer.



Pros:
Sleek and aggressive styling
Powerful sound

331574212,5,Great Gaming Speakers To Complete Your RGB Set Up,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I started playing Cyber Punk 2077 on my PC as of late and usually always wear my headphones for all my PC gaming.  I wanted another option and ran across these speakers by Razer.  I have a lot of Razer gear and have always had good luck with their products.  The first thing for me is always sound which this set offered THX Spacial sound so that was a plus.  The second bonus for me was the RGB backlighting on the left and right speakers.  I was excited to unbox Razer's new Nommo V2 Speakers when it arrived.  Set up was super easy.  Now for the test.  I highly recommend downloading the Razer Synapse app so you can control the sound of the speakers.  There is the normal option and the equalizer, the bass level adjustment and the option for the THX spatial sound.  First, I watched a few youtube videos with some THX sound videos to mess with the different sound options. I started with the normal setting with the equalizer adjustment and then switched to the THX Spatial option.  Next, I started up the game (CyberPunk 2077) and couldn't believe the sound coming out of the speakers.  It was full yet clear with a bass that wasn't super overpowering.  I could hear everything from all sides.  It was like I was in the game.  I played for 4 hours enjoying every minute of it.  At the same time, I loved the RGB that was displayed as I played.

Everything comes packaged nicely in stages with the Subwoofer to the left and it has a strap around it making it easy to lift out of the box. Accessories come packaged together and lifting the speakers out have a dedicated grip to get both at the same time.

Razer has a certain aesthetic to all their products and the Nommo speakers have that sleek, clean, black edgy look. I love that the Subwoofer is wireless so you can place it anywhere you like. Setup is very clean and straight forward and took me less than 10 minutes routing cables and off we go.

This is completely USB based so you will need an open port but the good thing is there is no analog all digital. Once you plug them in they are recognized and enabled immediately by Windows 11. You can start using them right away as is but the default setting with the pulsing lights and a bit too much bass was too much for me so I downloaded their Synapse software.

It is a pretty big download (~700MB) and takes a bit to install. You must have an account to login and use it. The software also detected my Razer mouse. Synapse allows you to adjust the RGB (or turn it off) along with the Bass, treble and switch between 2.1 stereo mode or THX. The software is very easy to use.

As for the quality of the speakers, they are good. Not exceptional, but good. They are replacing my old Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 setup and after testing several audio tracks and games, they are better. Bass is deep and punchy, mids and highs are good. One area they shine better than my Klipsch are the mids which were always their weakness.

I found the speakers plenty loud and left the audio at 50% and adjusted as needed within the programs and games I was playing.

The speakers come with a Pog for turning them off and on, volume control, pause and next track functions. It has some metal properties and is stylish and sleek. You can also control the same functions from the desktop but the Pog makes it quick and easy for baseline functions.

In summary, if you have a Razer setup already going and want a good set of external speakers with RGB and nice bass, this is as good a selection as any. On the other hand, if you're on a budget, have no desire for RGB or Razer branding along with needing their software to get the most out of the speakers, you may want to look elsewhere.

I like them enough to recommend them if you can swallow the relatively high price for a 2.1 setup.",2023-12-15T07:23:51,Electrosoft,Best Buy US,False
318832870,5,Absolutely Insane for Gaming and Music,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] At first I was on the fence about spending $300 for a set of PC speakers. I wanted them to sound good for music and gaming. I went on YouTube and watched some reviews, also read reviews. I decided to go for it.. I am very happy I spent the money. They sound amazing. Set up was very simple, had one software update and one firmware update, took maybe 10 minutes at most. They are bluetooth capable which I love. Absolutely no issues at all. RGB lights are fully customizable, There's presets you can use or set your EQ how you like it. Very easy to switch bluetooth back and forth from different devices. The subwoofer is insane, the 2 desktop speakers are amazing as well. I've had these for about a month and not one issue. Razer software works great, no sound glitches, no cutting in and out..

332045976,5,Incredibly Immersive PC Audio Upgrade!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having recently acquired the Razer - Nommo V2 Pro Full-Range 2.1 PC Gaming Speakers, I am happy to share my experience. These speakers are not just another gadget; they're an immersive experience that enhances every gaming session.

 

Firstly, the wireless subwoofer is a game-changer. The bass is exceptionally deep and powerful, far exceeding my expectations. It's not just about the intensity; the clarity of the bass adds a new dimension to gaming, making every explosion and bass-heavy soundtrack feel like it's happening right around me.

 

The sound quality of the speakers themselves is incredible. They deliver a crystal-clear audio experience that's both nuanced and robust. Whether it's the subtle rustle of leaves in a game or the complex layers of a music track, these speakers capture every detail with impressive fidelity. The THX Spatial Audio feature makes the whole gaming experience come alive!

 

The wireless volume dial is an awesome touch. It’s heavy and made of mostly aluminum and plastic with a rubber base. I will admit, it was a little tricky at first… Pro tip, push the whole button down for 3 seconds to turn on your speakers, and there is a little button on the side that switches sources. Nonetheless, I love that the V2PRO version comes with this nifty add-on, it looks great and it’s functional. Makes audio volume control so quick and easy, instead of having to use your cursor to navigate down into the task bar taking away precious gaming seconds.

 

The RGB lighting is a stroke of genius. It's not just aesthetically pleasing; it's smart and integrative. Using the Razer Synapse app, the RGB lighting syncs effortlessly with other Razer peripherals, PC lighting, and even live wallpapers, creating a cohesive and dynamic gaming environment. This feature elevates the speakers from being mere sound devices to an integral part of a gamer's setup.

 

Build quality is another area where these speakers shine. They're solidly constructed, with a weight that speaks to their durability and quality. This heft ensures they stay firmly in place, providing both a visual and auditory anchor to my gaming station.

 

Lastly, the design deserves special mention. On my desk, these speakers manage the rare feat of blending in while simultaneously being a focal point. Their aesthetic is both sophisticated and bold, echoing the ethos of modern gaming culture. Never enough RBG lighting!!

 

In conclusion, the Razer - Nommo V2 Pro Full-Range 2.1 PC Gaming Speakers with Wireless Subwoofer are a phenomenal addition to any gamer's arsenal. They deliver on every front – sound quality, design, easy to setup, ease of use, functionality, and integration. If you're looking to elevate your gaming/movie watching experience, look no further. These speakers are an investment you won't regret.",2024-01-13T02:36:50,RogueWave,Best Buy US,False
331788121,4,Nice sound with some quirks,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros
Strong bass
Clean highs
Good simulated center channel
Lighting enhances gameplay
Lighting syncs with other Razer products
More setup options versus their soundbar option
Easy wireless setup
Realistic spatial audio
Also offers Bluetooth connectivity

Cons
Only two input options
No stereo jack
Lighting effects don’t match with game
Limited manual lighting controls
Speakers enter sleep mode sometimes even when in use
Speakers don’t automatically wake from sleep
No Bluetooth adjustments
Fixing randomly sleep mode means manually turning speakers on/off
Controls are only on puck which can get lost, such as switching inputs
Puck has limited control options
Subwoofer randomly disconnects when off/asleep

The Razer Nommo V2 Pro is the top tier in the lineup of gaming speakers for those who prefer individual speakers versus their soundbar option. Razer did a nice job packaging every nicely with everything protected and held in place with thick foam. In fact, they did such a good job the whole family missed the control puck when it was first unboxed. The first thing that stands out is just how big the speakers are. Unlike most gaming speakers these have some heft to them. For smaller desk setups it might be challenging to find space. Similarly, the subwoofer is large. There are no controls, input jacks, or output jacks on the speakers. The speakers are only controlled via the wireless puck or via Synapse.

Setup 9/10
Basic setup is extremely easy. Just plug the speakers into power and the USB-A cord into the computer. The speakers are USB-C but the included cord is USB-C to USB-A.  You can place the subwoofer anywhere since it is wireless. Similarly, the control puck just needs the batteries installed and you are up and running. All components are paired wirelessly from the factory. The first time you plug them in they turn on automatically and are ready to go. You can pair Bluetooth devices by switching modes using the control puck. While easy to do, the downside is without the small and easy to lose wireless puck, functionality of the speakers is limited. If you are prone to losing things on your desk, you may wish to tape the control puck down.

Controls and Customizability 6/10
The puck can be used to turn the RGB lights on and off, but all other lighting controls are done via Synapse. In Bluetooth mode the only lighting option you have is on and off. Any EQ settings in Bluetooth mode would need to be done via the Bluetooth source if available on the playback device. In Synapse, you can customize the general lighting effects like breathing, spectrum cycling, etc., similar to other Razer products. With compatible games it automatically chooses the lighting effect unless overridden. There is no option to create custom lighting profiles per game when overridden. You can have the lighting effects match other Razer products that use Synapse. You have a 10 band EQ to adjust the sound and a THX Spatial audio off/on option. Spatial audio reduces bass slighting in favor of a larger soundstage and placement of sounds.

One oddity worth mentioning is the power saving mode. Like all speakers the Nommo V2 Pro has an automatic power save mode. What is odd is it only applies to powering off. The instructions don’t make it clear but when they fall asleep for any reason you must manually turn them back on with puck. What is even more strange is in some games, such as Forza and Halo, the speakers would time out and fall asleep as if they were not in use. This is understandably frustrating if you are in the middle of a firefight. The only way around this is to completely turn off the auto power off function and manually turn the speakers on and off. It is uncertain if Razer can improve this via updates but as it stands, your best bet is to have them be fully manual.

Lighting 4/10
Of course, with this being Razer you must talk about the lighting. The promotional materials make you think the effect is going to do something to immerse you more into the game, but it is more of the regular Razer lighting. While the effect is nice as a wall wash it doesn’t really add to the gameplay, at least currently. For example, there is a profile for Halo Infinite. When launching Halo the speakers changes to flashing white. Your first thought might be the speakers would change colors based on possible muzzle flash or what the background scenery is to create more immersion. In reality, no matter what was happening in the game, the speakers just flashed white somewhat like lighting. This just seems like a missed opportunity. Hopefully Razer is still polishing the way this works and eventually the effects will be more dynamic and based on gameplay.

Sound Performance 8/10
Out of the box sound quality is decent. Bass is heavy and almost boomy but adds impacts to games. It can easily fill a medium sized room. By default the mids are slightly weak but still reasonable.  Even with adjustment the bass feels a bit boomy but not offensively so. With adjustment the overall range is respectable but not outstanding. Games feel dynamic and music feels lively. With so much bass it’s so surprise that bass heavy music does with the Nommo V2 Pros. What is more of a surprise is acoustic is represented well. If you are away from the speakers then they sound better with Spatial audio off, but sitting in front of them the Spatial effects provide a sense of depth and soundstage. Spatial Audio is where having two discreet speakers helps. You can adjust each speaker to create your sweet spot for spatial effects to match your seating position. There is a distinct spot where the spatial effect is strongest and where it drops off sharply. Sitting in the sweet spot, in-games sounds have good placement. The simulated center channel is very good. The left and ride side are distinct with a modest amount of sound placement behind. Placement of sounds is stronger to the front and sides compared to the back, but the overall effect gives you a good idea where sounds are coming from without headphones or speakers all around you. The only downside is the speaker stands aren’t adjustable themselves. This means that if you sit higher or lower than normal you can’t just point the speakers up or down to move the sweet spot. You either need to move yourself up or down or prop up the speakers higher. It’s a minor inconvenience but it would have been nice if the speaker stands at least could adjust vertical tilt.

Final Thoughts
Overall, the Razer Nommo V2 Pro are very nice speakers that do a respectable job as both gaming and music speakers. Sound quality is not top tier but close after EQ adjustments. The main gripe is the power save function. If Razer could enhance the in-game functionality of the lighting to enhance gameplay, this package could be hard to beat even with the quirks. If you are in the market for gaming speakers with excellent spatial audio, decently well-rounded audio quality, and like the idea of RGB lighting effects then the Razer Nommo V2 Pro is worth considering.",2024-01-11T06:35:26,CraigB,Best Buy US,False
331645729,5,"Game changing, ear blasting PC sound","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the final components to my latest PC build has been to refresh and upgrade my speakers to something more up-to-date compared to the ones I have had for a few years which, by the way, are also considered on the high-end of the market.  This happened to be just in time for the new drop of the pro series Razer Nommo V2 Full-Range 2.1 PC gaming speakers with a wireless subwoofer which appeared to be right up my alley.  As an audiophile, anything that gets the THX certification has my full and immediate attention.  This high-end certification coupled with the latest advanced audio features including virtual 7.1 surround sound that feels like the sound is on the side and behind you, 3” full-range drivers with aluminum phase plugs to minimize sound reflections and a 5.5” down-firing wireless subwoofer combine to provide a truly immersive sound experience for PC and console gamers alike that prefer or have an option to go without headphones.  You can sync other devices to them and switch to the Bluetooth input through the Razer software.  Regarding the appearance, you can immediately tell they are high-end PC speakers not only because of back-lit Razer Chroma RGB lighting which changes colors but also due to the exposed drivers with piercing cones.  The wireless control pod/knob is a convenient short cut when having to quickly adjust the volume up/down without having to navigate to the volume controls on your screen or with some speakers having to reach to find the volume knob.  However, it is an extra peripheral you’ll have to find a spot for on your desk.  These are definitely the best sounding computer speakers, and many other speakers I have used for music in our house, and would recommend them for anyone that wants to step up their sound game.",2024-01-10T02:00:12,Grouticus,Best Buy US,False
331640759,5,Excellent Gaming Speakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Unboxing and setup/configuration were easy, and everything came nicely packed and well-protected.  Inside the box comes two speakers, a subwoofer, power cables, a wireless control pod (with two AAA batteries), a manual, and a USB to USB-C cable to connect the speaker to a computer (source).  Note that you can connect the speaker via the USB cable or Bluetooth; I prefer using the provided USB cables.  Of course, I use Bluetooth mode when connecting a mobile device to the speakers.  The speakers and the subwoofer feel and look premium made.  The side speakers are hard plastic and feel heavy, and the stand/base is big enough that they will not swivel and stay fixed.  They have a pleasant and slick design.  The subwoofer is a perfect size for a gaming/PC system, and the casing feels like it is made of wood.  The side speakers connect to the subwoofer, the subwoofer connects to the PC/device, and the speaker system control is on the right side speakers.  The side speakers can’t be angled up or down; they are in a fixed position.  To maximize the speaker system experience, I highly recommend downloading the Razer Synapse.  This will allow the user to control the sub, the EQ, THC spatial audio, and personalize speaker lighting.
The wireless control pod (puck-like) is the central hub for the system.  The pod is easy to use: (1) to turn on the system, press the pod for three seconds; (2) to mute and unmute, click the pod once; (3) to skip, triplet click, (4) switch source (eg, PC to BlueTooth), press the side button, and (5) volume adjust by rotating the dial clockwise or counterclockwise.  The biggest reason to consider this speaker system is that the sound is an absolute joy.  I listen to everything with them, from hardcore to hip-hop (any genre) to YouTube videos, movies, and more.  I have raised the volume to the max and experienced no distortion or drop in quality.  The RGB lighting is excellent, with the lights being more static, cycling through the colors at a slower pace and providing a more pleasant listening experience.  This excellent speaker system will increase your gaming, music, and movie listening experience.",2024-01-10T01:08:21,SimpleLiving,Best Buy US,False
332460441,5,Simply the Best,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow! Just wow. I’ve owned various PC speaker setups. Some gaming systems, some more for music and while those seemed very impressive at the time, none of them can hold a candle to what Razer is doing with this set. 

I have a respectable gaming setup in my media room. Nice PC gaming setup and PS5 connected to the same Gaming Monitor, while I have full sound systems in my living room and bedroom, I wanted something good for when I want to immerse myself in a game without having to lean on my headsets. This 2.1 system by Razer feels much wider than a traditional 2.1 system.

Just unboxing it I could tell that this was a very premium system, the 2 speakers are much larger than I had anticipated, and the wireless sub and remote volume control also feel very premium. Even the cords feel like they are high quality. The entire system has a great heft and premium feel to it.

Connecting them all together was seamless despite their are 2 wireless components. Everything just paired together without a hitch. When I connected them to my PS5 with the USB cable it recognized immediately and the sound was amazing. When I connected them to me PC it took a little adjustments in the Settings to make sure my PC saw them as an Audio device and defaulted to them. No issues once I had that squared away.

The sound, everything you could imagine and then some. Games surround you, and music is so clear and powerful. I was playing the new Spiderman 2 on my PS5 and it really helps to add to immersion. The sub does an amazing job of making you feel the explosions from the game. You can hear things all around you, and everything is just crisp. I had the same experience when I started using them on my PC to play some Diablo 4, and Destiny. Everything just feels and sounds amazing. My teenage sons even came in to see what was going on. They thought I was watching a movie in the living room. One of them even asked if I could turn it down cause they could feel it in their room.

The RGB lighting on the back of each speaker is great and helps to add to the atmosphere of my room. I love that you can adjust and customize it with the app on the PC. 

These are Premium Gaming Speakers at a premium price, but they are worth if. It gives your games, music, movies another layer that you can appreciate. It’s one of my favorite additions to my gaming addiction in the last couple of years. This is an easy recommendation for anyone looking to level up their gaming setup, or really wants to make the gamer in their life happy.",2024-01-16T14:55:48,Balboa3,Best Buy US,False
331821100,5,High quality sound in not so compact speakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The first thing I noticed about these when I took them out of the box was how much larger they were than I had expected. I hadn't seen them in person and just got them right offline and I was honestly expecting them to be somewhat smaller. They have good weight to them as well and are definitly quality speakers from a build aspect. 

Sound quality is phenomenal though, with very crisp and clear highs and suprisingly deep bass from the wireless subwoofer. One key feature I like is the THX Spatial Audio to really enhance games when you are playing them. I could hear people all around me when playing a few FPS games I really enjoy. You can also use predefined profiles for games or create your own settings by game if you want for Racing games or FPS games or Sports games. 

Setup was pretty straighforward and took about 10 minutes with rearranging some things on my desk to get them where I wanted them in front of my moniotr. If you have other Razer products with LED's or light effects you can customize all of them to be in synch via the Razer Synapse software. You can change a lot of effects although it can be a bit overwhelming if you aren't familar with the app if you are trying to really customize your lighting setup. One annying thing about all their apps though is if you are running a dynamic wallpaper via the Razer Axon app you can't jsut adjust or change the color settings since that has taken over the color effects for your system. I personally don't really need to get every device on my desktop in synch but for streamers like my kids I can see how this is a cool feature with their software.

Overall these speakers really remind me of the Original Klipsch 2.1 speakers I had in college when I first started gaming before all these gaming component companies existed. The audio is robust, clear, and has booming bass for when I really want to feel a game. They look good also but be aware of the size as they are not small satellite speakers as you might hting from the images on the website.",2024-01-11T15:28:38,ShaunOrlando,Best Buy US,False
331711907,4,"Incredible sound, some quirks.","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Unboxing the Nommo V2 and setting it up is quite the experience. I am always impressed by the build quality of Razer products. The speakers are lighter than I thought, and although they may appear bulky, their footprint accommodates even a small desk. The speakers are permanently angled so it would’ve been nice if they could be adjusted vertically. Although there are cables to connect from the right speaker to the left and then to the PC, I definitely appreciate the wireless subwoofer and control knob, which paired to the speakers immediately. The down-firing subwoofer is of medium size and can be placed anywhere in the room, which helps in keeping the area around the desk clutter-free. Once installed, the RGB glow can be quite nice, but also a bit finicky.

There is only one physical USB-C port. This severely limits connectivity as there is no AUX input or headphone jack, and it is quite puzzling being such a premium device. I have a dual PC setup and a gaming station, so that is disappointing. Sure, there is also Bluetooth, but that brings a couple of issues with syncing and RGB light responses. Plus, there is no multi-point option, so I must unpair and pair when switching from PC Bluetooth to my phone. Good thing I don’t really use that option.

Once hooked up, Installing the Nommo via Razer Synapse can be frustrating as several updates needed to be done. I had some fails, re-downloads, and device recognition issues that took some time to resolve. Once all setup, I was pleased by the robust features, customization, and personalization. There, you can keep up with the latest firmware updates, change/customize RGB lighting, use the equalizer, and more. I did experience a couple more hiccups where the changes did not take but worked out in the end. I trust Razer will continue to improve the software.

But most importantly (at least for me) is the sound quality. Out of the box, I was immediately impressed. I have several speaker setups and by far the magnitude of these blew me away. I did not have to raise the volume over 30% to have the entire office shaking. By the way, the control puck worked very smoothly. The midrange and upper frequencies come through clearly at both low and high volume. At its loudest, the bass can be overwhelming and there is some distortion. But again, this is only at concert levels, which 99% of the time won’t be necessary. Plus, the bass can be toned down (I have it slightly below the mid-level). Playing music is great, but there are some clarity and imaging issues. However, when gaming and watching movies, it was a delight and quite the experience. As far as details when playing games, this system performed very well. I could perceive where the sounds were coming from, and the detail and environmental sound queues added to the immersion. Speaking of immersion, Razers offers THX spatial audio. This adds a high level of depth and 360-degree audio positioning. It's not quite surround, but it does provide a believable sensation, especially when playing content that supports it. Music, however, is best enjoyed with it off in stereo in my opinion. Again, the audio can be fully adjusted via Synapse.

In the end, the Nommo V2 Pro delivers sound that needs to be experienced to be fully believed. Also, the wireless subwoofer and control pod is such a welcome option to keep the area nice and clutter-free.  However, the software and RGB quirks, strange connectivity limitations, and premium tag put a dent on this otherwise excellent speaker system.",2024-01-10T17:43:37,insomniak1,Best Buy US,False

331634679,4,A Great Pair of Gaming Speakers!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Nommo V2 Pro Gaming Speaker(4-piece) is a pricy gaming speaker. This is not your typical music studio speaker set which is even pricier but for a gaming setup (especially for PC), these are perfect. I have taken the time to review this 4-piece set and in short, Razer did a great job with these but improvements can certainly be made. This is my review of the Razer Nommo V2 Pro Gaming Speakers.

*TLDR at the bottom

============
IN THE BOX/SETUP:
In the box, you get a pair of the Razer Nommo V2 Pro speakers, a wireless subwoofer, a wireless control pod, a USB-A to USB-C cable, a power adapter for the speakers (some regional plugs are included too), a power cord for the subwoofer, and 2 AAA batteries.

First, I want to acknowledge the attention to detail that was given to the packing of the materials. Everything was neatly packed and organized. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. Just make sure you have everything plugged in all the way because I didn’t initially and was dumbfounded about why the speakers weren’t turning on after following all the instructions correctly. Setup took about 20 minutes. 

I tested the speakers with my PC, PS5, and phone for Bluetooth functionality.

============
FEATURES (HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE):
If you hate wires, you will love these. These speakers have the bare minimum when it comes to wires. Some of the wires are braided too so they are great quality and should have minimal tangling. The two desk speakers have customizable RGB if they are connected to a PC. Outside of a computer, the RGB is not customizable. The subwoofer is wireless as well as the control pod. The control pod is used to control the speakers. This is essentially the “remote” for these speakers. I would’ve preferred an actual remote with different built-in functions like audio inputs(USB, Bluetooth), audio presets, volume control, RGB shutoff button, etc. The control pod has some basic functions like play/pause, mute, and next but it is still very limited if you want to control the speakers from far away.

In terms of software features, there are plenty included with these speakers. I will be speaking on behalf of the features available with Razer’s Synapse software on PC. There is currently no other software available that allows for customization. Within Synapse, one can switch between Stereo and THX Spatial Audio. Both modes sound amazing, but I have noticed a greater sound stage with THX Spatial Audio. The surround sound when playing music, games, or a movie is vast and sounds incredible. Pair this mode with some custom EQ settings and you have everything you need for great sound. Within EQ settings there are default audio presets for movies, games, etc., but the lows, mids, and highs can be customized to your liking too.  There are a lot of RGB modes available and like with any Razer device, they will sync with your other RGB devices. 

============
SOUND QUALITY:
Whether you are gaming, listening to music, or watching a movie, these speakers will blow you away. (literally, so be careful not to turn it up all the way) The out-of-the-box sound is perfect, but I enjoy the work of fine-tuning the audio. I have previously mentioned that Razer’s Synapse software allows you to play around with the EQ settings. I highly recommend playing around with the EQ until you find that sweet spot for your ears. You won’t regret the time it takes. The subwoofer adds a deep bass to the sound stage and combined with THX Spatial Audio, the surround sound is seriously immersive. If these had a remote control, I could see these being perfect for an at-home mini movie theatre. In terms of PC gaming, these do an excellent job of providing the immersive sound that game developers want you to hear. Whether you are in an emotional cutscene or shooting down helicopters in Far Cry 6, everything will sound great. 

These speakers can be used with a PS5. All you need to do is plug the USB cable into the PS5 and the PS5 will automatically detect the speakers. Unfortunately, there is no way to manage EQ settings or RGB when using the speaker with a console. However, the vast sound stage still exists and sounds great with whatever game you are playing. 

Regarding Bluetooth functionality and sound, there is not too much to it. Click the single button on the control pod and the speakers will go into Bluetooth mode. Connect your phone and that is it. There is no way to control the RGB which by default goes into audio visualizer mode. EQ can be adjusted within your phone’s settings. Music and podcasts still sound great.

============
POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:
I have mostly covered the pros of these gaming speakers but there are certainly some improvements that can be made. I will list them down below.

-The control pod is limited, a remote with multiple input options (USB, Bluetooth, etc.), multiple audio presets, different RGB options, volume, subwoofer level, etc. would’ve been nice to control the sound when connected to either a console or using Bluetooth

-As a user of an ultrawide monitor, I struggled to find a good position for the two bulky desk speakers. It would’ve been if these were height-adjustable to accommodate someone with a large or many monitors or someone with limited desk space  
-Limited RGB customization when connected to other devices. Some form of a button to shut off RGB would’ve been neat in case the RGB needs to be turned off (e.g. movie night)

-An analog or optical input would’ve been nice to have to plug these speakers into a TV.

-Switching to PC from Bluetooth mode is not the most efficient, rather than clicking the control pod button, you instead need to unplug the USB-A cable and plug it into the PC to switch modes, a remote with a dedicated button would streamline this process 

-This is more of a request but RGB on the subwoofer would’ve been neat, the subwoofer is pretty bland

============
CONCLUSION/TLDR:
Overall, Razer hit a home run with the Nommo V2 PC Gaming Speakers. The vibrant sound of the speakers and the thumping sound of the subwoofer allows for an immersive experience whether you are gaming, watching a movie, or listening to music. The customization for these speakers on PC is vast and neat to have as an option. I did have trouble finding space for the bulky speakers and would’ve liked them to be adjustable. The control pod while nice is extremely limited for controlling the speakers from afar. There were other minor drawbacks listed above but if they aren’t too bothersome, I wholeheartedly recommend you give these gaming speakers a shot!",2024-01-10T00:25:18,BarackObama,Best Buy US,False
332410715,5,Must have gaming setup,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] THE BREAKDOWN:

The Razer Nommo V2 Pro Gaming speaker (4-Piece) is a full range speaker system.  I wouldn’t say this is studio quality, but it is definitely high end.

What’s in the box: 

First, I want to say that extreme care and thought went into packaging this system.   You can tell it is high-end quality from the moment you open the box.  In the box you will get a pair of Razer Nommo V2 Pro speakers, Wireless subwoofer, Razer Wireless Control Pod, USB Type A to USB Type C cable and power adapters to include regional plugs for both the speaker and subwoofer.  You also get two AAA batteries.

The skinny:

These speakers have minimum wires which make this an easy setup.  One thing to mention about the wires is that some of them are braided which gives that high end upgraded feel and look.  The pair of speakers do have customizable RGB if they are connected to a computer.  The subwoofer is wireless and down firing and has a 5.5” driver.  You do get a control pod that looks like a hockey puck.  With this you have a few controls like volume and audio control. 
There are plenty of software features with controls included with this one!  With Synapse you can switch between THX Spatial Audo with its 7.1 surround sound and stereo.  Whether you are playing games or listening to music these speakers really deliver.  These sound amazing right out of the box with no adjusting.  I recommend you spend a little time adjusting the EQ, you will not be disappointed.

PRO’s:

 - Easy setup
 - High-end look and feel
 - Great App
 - Sound is amazing

CON’s: 

- I think the pair of speakers should be able to be adjusted up and down.  Not every setup needs the speaker pointed in that fixed position.

- The subwoofer is really underpowered.

SUMMARY:

Overall, this product worked as intended, and I would recommend this to a friend if they were in the market for an item like this.",2024-01-16T02:10:17,Ohanaman,Best Buy US,False
328755688,5,Not just for PC,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My man cave was in need of a sound upgrade, as the TV speakers weren’t doing the rest of my setup justice. 

The Razer Nommo V2 Pro box came neatly packaged with just the right amount of material to protect the speaker without having a bunch of needless cardboard.  Seems like a dumb detail, but to me, it was clearly thought out and purposeful. 

Setup instructions were very straightforward, with each speaker cable appropriately labeled “Left” and “Right” - then you plug them into the equally rationally labeled “Left” and “Right” jacks.  So simple. Plug the power cable in, and boom ready to go.  

Razer is synonymous with PC equipment, but the Nommo V2 Pros are also advertised to be compatible with PS5 and Switch. Really, you can either USB direct wire or you can use Bluetooth, so it’s pretty widely compatible.  

Standard for PC peripherals, there are RGB lights at the back of the directional speakers which you can adjust.  They’re not obnoxiously bright, but luckily the lights are customizable.

I did add a Satechi dock because of the minimal ports on the back of the Mac Mini, also for ease of use. Set up and data transfer was a breeze. The M2 chip is a real improvement over the old Intel chip in the iMac. I chose 512 GB model over 16GB RAM beause of cost. Plus Apple uses RAM differently than Intel. I  don't  run any memory intensive software like photo or video editng, so RAM did not matter. I was sorry to see my old faithful iMac go, but it's time had come.

Then I decided to check out Best Buy for an iMac 27” that’s when I noticed the term open box for 629$ It was listed as fair condition. I was extremely nervous because I wasn’t sure what damage it would have. Then I saw a Asian dude on YouTube who saved 1000$ and he said if you don’t like it just return it but not to hesitate because someone else will buy it. So I took the chance and brought it. The next day I picked it up took it home opened the box and couldn’t believe my eyes this was a brand like new imac not one scratch or dent anywhere. Wow wow wow I’m still in shock that I purchased this 27” iMac for 629$ when it was listed brand new for 1800$.

The wireless mouse and the wireless keyboard is a great addition. Furthermore, I can open and close multiple tabs and the iMac keeps up considering I'm the type to have so many apps open and do so many things at once!

Negatives 

A bit of a critique the fans are a little bit loud. Just a minor inconvenience.

The built-in apps that can't be uninstalled i.e Safari. I prefer google chrome. The Home App which I seldom use.Podcasts and News app and so many others which I don't use. They take up room and I'd much rather have them gone. I wish we had the ability to GET RID OF THEM with Apple products!

Subsequently, I wish  Apple Care wasn't so expensive. Hence, why I didn't purchase it. In my opinion, it's not worth it. However, if it was an iPhone or MacBook then YES it makes sense. You tend to carry them and move them and chances are they can either end up stolen or broken due to a fall. However, it's up to you!

 Also, I've had Apple products for a long time and I've never once had a virus or any malware problem. Furthermore, I've only had to replace the battery in my MacBook since it aged. Which cost me about 190 which wasn't bad. Plus it cost me almost 2k for the MacBook but it lasted 7-8 years so you have to put it in perspective. It was totally worth it! 

I'll go on a tangent and add the insurance and warranty for the iPhone is totally worth it someone stole my iPhone at iHop when I just finished paying for it and I haven't been the same since. But again as far as the warranty or insurance for the iMac I'm totally against it unless you live in a bad neighborhood lol jk. 

Last thing. I wish the iMac came in different colors.  For the price, we are paying that's one option I wish we had. I have a Macbook and they came in different colors.",2021-03-27T11:40:29,BrianKe1995,Best Buy US,True

It's connected to the subwoofer with a pretty long cable (maybe 6ft), so I have the subwoofer on the floor under my desk and the control easy extends up from under the desk and up the back of the desk, under the monitor, and sits midway on the desk.  I can connect my headphones easily to jack on the remote.  Remote has an on/off button too.  And the 2 side speakers I placed on the desk on each side of the monitor.",2019-12-15T04:51:47,Awesome,Best Buy US,True

They are perfectly balanced and are more than perfect for computer speakers. I have mine hooked up to my PS4 through an HDMI splitter so that might contribute to the performance of the speakers, but either way they are absolutely amazing. I've had them for a few days now and I still can't get over how incredible they are.
These would be very good as external TV speakers and they're more than enough as computer speakers or for gaming. They would even be perfect as speakers for your room for music playing in general.",2020-09-13T03:14:04,Carlos,Best Buy US,True

Will keep good clarity up to reasonably high volumes without cracking or distortion.  Excellent value.  Only issue we don't like is the cable going into the control module not being a plug that can be removed.

314562859,4,Good budget case for under $75!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a Micro ATX case and it is a bit smaller than a standard Mid ATX (i.e. NZXT H510 is the size that most people know.

It has good (not great) cable management and support for a few mounting arrangements. The PSU shroud makes hiding cabling better and helps prevent useless eddies of air current.

A couple of issues. First is that the front of the case, while obstensibly can fit up to a 280mm radiator or 3 120mm fans according to the manual, isn't set up properly for that. The cutout for the radiator in the PSU shroud is too thin and won't fit most radiators, and I struggled to get an average 240mm radiator to fit. Secondly, the mounting holes for fans don't line up the same for radiators, so to get three fans into it (as seen in my photos) each fan is only secured by two screws and not by all 4. They simply do not line up properly to fit all 3 120mm fans by all 4 corners.
Secondly, as other reviews have noted, the power button is in an awkward location. It is not recessed into the frame in any way, so it often gets hit accidentally while moving the case or even just reaching around it.

Overall, it is pretty good case regardless of these minor issues, but I wouldn't spend more than $75 max on it and wouldn't be reviewing it positively if I couldn't get it for under $50. (On sale $49.99 at the time of this review.)",2023-08-16T22:16:46,ERElectronics,Best Buy US,True

243389415,5,Brought Netflix Nature documentary to LIFE !!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It’s been quite some time since I’ve purchased a dedicated computer sound system, and have grown accustomed to using bluetooth earbuds, or built-in computer monitor speakers, that _seemed_ adequate enough.

Well, after launching a David Attenborough Nature video on YouTube and comparing the difference, I now see what I’ve been missing. Affordable computer audio got good real fast.

His voice had the deep baritone and breathiness that brought the Serengeti to life. My wife was working in her office a room away and perked right up and came in to comment how clear and good the computer sounded. 

I have to admit though that I felt stupid setting the system up, no instructions but none needed right, just plug and play audio. What I did not realize is that the control puck is required (operates on supplied AA batteries) and the pairing mode switch below the unit selects between modes. Once I uncovered this “a-ha” moment I was hooked. 


PROS
————
+ Innovative control puck is brilliant 
+ super simple setup, good wire lengths 
+ sound quality for cheap system is surprisingly good 
+ deeper bass than you’d think by looking at the sub size 
+ incredibly affordable price well above entry-level quality 
 
CONS
———
-plastic speakers and control puck feel cheaply made
-I had to look in the manual to operate and insert puck batteries 
-lack of THX certification like higher-end model 
-full wireless would make this truly next-gen 

CONCLUSION 
————————
I thought I was fine using LG UltraWide 38” monitor built-in speakers (no slouch) for audio. I’ve had dedicated systems in the past but they were embarrassingly low-quality, tinny sound, cumbersome wires, and unsightly.

241549275,5,Remarkable Sound and Features,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been a fan of logitech for over a decade now and have used many of their products from mices and keyboards to headsets so when I say the Logitech - Z407 Bluetooth speaker I decided to give it a try. Inside the box, you’re first greeted with a quick setup guide on the inside cover, followed by the subwoofer, two stereo satellite speakers and their stands , the wireless remote, a pair of AAA batteries, the necessary connecting cables including a 3.5mm audio cable and some paperwork.
 
Setting this system up was a breeze, as soon as you put the batteries into the wireless remote and plug the power cord that's attached to the subwoofer into an outlet the two are instantly connected and you hear a sound that signifies this. The wireless remote by default was in the bluetooth pairing mode( noted by a blue blinking light on the remote) and I tried pairing it to both my phone and my computer and there were no issues there. You are also given the opportunity to connect not only by bluetooth but also by 3.5mm audio cable and also a usb audio cable (not provided in box). Each of these ports can be found on the back of the subwoofer. 

Some things to note are that the dial is very intuitive to use. Not only are the controls displayed on the transparent wrap covering the dial but if you have used any recent bluetooth headphone the controls will be familiar such as depressing the control once to play/stop and double depressing to skip to the next song etc. Turning clockwise increases the volume and anticlockwise decreases it. You are also able to control the bass level from the remote. Depressing the remote for more than 5 secs will put you into bass control (noted by a distinct sound that plays) where increasing/decreasing is based on clockwise/anticlockwise turns. To exit bass mode just depress the remote again until the sound is heard once more. On the underside of the remote u will find the plate you need to remove to insert/remove batteries as well as two buttons, one for bluetooth connectivity and one that cycles through the other two audio connection modes, i.e 3.5mm cable (magenta) and usb cable(white). The satellite speakers design allows for their stand to be either placed at their base or at their sides allowing for vertical and horizontal orientation. I greatly appreciate having this option and can tell I’ll be going back and forth between these two stances.

So how do they sound…. Great. I have had more expensive computer systems and at this price point and sound I am all in. I threw various audio files and programs at it, even games and I was still pleasantly surprised at how well it performed. Interestingly enough I must say audio sounded better/ more impressive when connected through bluetooth ( I swear!!). Music and movies sounded great and the bass was just enough to feel enough boom to the audio without any distortion even when the bass mode was at max.I must also note that the remote control effect was instantaneous, meaning I noticed no lag while using the remote.

This system is great and despite this I know it is not for everybody. If you recently got a new setup or even if you don’t and you’re just looking to upgrade an older system you’ve had for while without breaking the bank, I highly suggest this. You have multiple connection options including Bluetooth and the sound is great.",2020-10-29T18:12:30,Jaydozrock,NY,False
241686622,5,Great design and sound to match,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am always listening to music, so when opportunities to review headphones, earbuds and speakers come around - I jump right in. 

Pros:
Wireless volume control
Great sound
Easily tuned subwoofer levels

Cons:
Dial bottom grip affected by dusty and can then slip around
Loud mode change (volume vs sub) chime
Inconsistent browser interaction

While opening the box for these Logitech Z704 speakers for setup, the wireless volume dial was right up top. While unpacking, it’s noticeable that all three pieces of the setup were packaged well. The speakers require their own wire with color-coded RCA plug to the subwoofer. The length of the wire is enough that I can use them without issue on my motorized stand-up desk in stand-up mode without putting strain on the cables.

The speakers are a bit bigger than I had anticipated from seeing images. When on their side, they are 8 inches (20 cm) wide by just shy of 4 inches (10 cm) high and 3 inches (7.6 mm) deep at the biggest dimensions.. They ALMOST fit under my home made monitor stand as the front is too tall and therefore can’t go completely under (see pic).

Pairing was quite simple given the button on the bottom of the dial. I paired it very quickly with both an Alienware Aurora R9 running Windows 10 and Google Pixel Slate running ChromeOS. Bluetooth selection from the device will steal it from the active one once paired, as expected and a chime indicates that there was some sort of pairing accomplished. 

This set also supports 3.5mm audio sources and those that connect via USB when hooked up to the subwoofer, should you not want to (or are not able to) use Bluetooth. Switching between the modes (USB/3.5/BT) is as easy as pushing a button under the dial right next to the Bluetooth pairing button. 

The wireless volume dial is a great idea and uses AAA batteries. It has a decent rubberized grip on the bottom, but make sure you dust your placement area first, the dial will slide around if it’s dusty. 

During all my initial use after setup, the subwoofer was emitting a static sound & popping. I reached out to Logitech with a video of the issue and it was replaced very quickly. The rest of the review is based on the replacement speaker set.

I found the volume dial to be very responsive when in use. When your computer or other device goes to sleep, so does the dial. At that point, you have to tap and wait a second or two for it to wake up, so you can adjust the volume again. For example, I was listening for a while and got a call and I found that rotating the dial to lower the volume, didn’t do anything. Pressing down on the dial and waiting a few seconds gave me control back; I’d almost rather the action of rotating the dial be enough to wake it from a sleep / power save state.

Adjusting the bass by holding down the dial is good and saves me from going under the desk for a manual adjustment on other vendors, however the chime to let you know you’re in subwoofer adjustment mode (vs volume mode) is LOUD! A chime more in line with the current volume would be better, but at least you know you’re adjusting the bass for that moment. 

Control of pause/skip/rewind does NOT work on Windows Chrome or the YouTube Music (YTM) App, but it does with Edge. Weird. Controlling the audio / music stream in ChromeOS with YTM in either Chrome or the App, works as expected. It’s tough to go to Chrome on Windows from ChromeOS and lose pause / skip capabilities for a browser you use primarily; I don’t like using Edge. On a side note, a nice minor change to the dial, would be a slight indentation for your finger, if you wanted to spin the top to adjust the volume like you were using a Google Home speaker, vs spinning it at the middle.

I’m happy with Sound, the bass and overall appearance of the Logitech Z704 speakers. I listen to most genres of music, but am more regularly a Cali Reggae and Alternative Rock listener. From guitar to keyboards and brass, these speakers are nice and pack a punch when pressed to do so.

If you need a nice 2.1 computer speaker set and don’t mind that the speakers need to be hard-wired to the subwoofer, I’d say pick these up. If you have a Tenkeyless keyboard (like me!) and it doesn’t have volume control, the wireless dial is a time and annoyance saver.

Or, if you have anything that supports a 3.5mm plug for output and no Bluetooth (old iPod, Echo Dot, etc.), this will bring life back to the old device and/or add superior audio value wherever it’s used.

Overall, it’s a nice setup and if the design works for you, I have no doubt that the sound will be delivered.",2020-10-31T01:46:40,nhtechie,"Nashua, NH",False
241990913,5,"Incredible Versatility, Sound, and Value","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using Logitech's entry-level $25 computer speakers for years and had never really given any thought to upgrading them until I saw the Z407 announced. I had to do a double-take when I saw the price: a subwoofer, Bluetooth, and wireless controls for under $80? Seemed too good to be true, but I'm happy to report that Logitech has delivered a superb speaker system at a remarkable price.

=== SETUP ===
The system comes in a compact but surprisingly heavy box. Be prepared to remove a lot of packaging and wrapping as the box is tightly packed. Unfortunately, the only setup and operating instructions provided are printed on the flaps at the top of the box, and it consists entirely of pictures and no text. Luckily, it's pretty straightforward to connect the system to a computer using the standard aux cable (included). The subwoofer basically acts as the hub of the system, with both speakers connecting directly to the subwoofer, and then the subwoofer plugged into your power outlet. There are certainly a lot of wires to deal with, so you'll want to have some cable ties handy or a desk big enough to hide the wires behind.

My only complaint is that it's not immediately obvious how you switch the system between wired and Bluetooth modes. When I first plugged it into my computer I thought I had received a defective unit. Turns out you have to flip over the wireless control dial and select the desired input using a very small dedicated button. If you want to switch to Bluetooth, there's a Bluetooth button. There is a picture demonstrating this on the box, but again, without any written instructions, it's easy to miss.

I love how the speakers can be positioned either vertically or horizontally based on your desk size or personal preferences. There is a removable stand for each speaker that makes it very easy to switch orientations.

=== CONNECTIONS AND CONTROLS ===
The system supports Bluetooth, 3.5mm wired, and USB connections. Everything is controlled through the wireless dial. The dial looks neat and functions just fine, but you'll probably want to download the full user guide from Logitech's website so you can learn all of it's functions and what the each light color means (white = USB; purple = 3.5mm; blue = Bluetooth). The only way to switch between these three connections is via the buttons on the bottom of the dial. I really wish there was an iOS app or Windows application that would make this easier.

Rotating the dial adjusts volume. To adjust the bass level, press and hold the dial for 2 seconds until you hear a tone, and then rotate the dial to adjust bass. Unfortunately, there no way to tell how many levels of adjustment there are (for either volume or bass). Additionally, the dial does not adjust the volume directly on your computer, so you have two volume levels to consider: whatever your computer is set to, and the volume level of the Logitech speakers set by the wireless dial.

You can also control audio tracks using the dial, but only when connected via USB or Bluetooth. One click = play/pause; two clicks = skip forward; 3 clicks = rewind. There is so much going on with the dial that I had to print out the user manual from Logitech's website to keep on my desk. I'm sure I will memorize all of it eventually.

=== SOUND QUALITY ===
Simply put, I don't think you'll find better sounding computer speakers in this price range. The down-firing subwoofer adds some much-needed oomph compared to a cheaper two-speaker system. And luckily, the subwoofer is relatively small and should fit in almost any setup. With the bass turned up about two thirds of the way, the lows on this system rival those of an entry-level TV sound bar.

As someone who has been working from home for the past several months, I always play music from iTunes while working at my computer. And the Z407 truly fills my apartment with rich, full-bodied sound. It won't rival premium, multi-channel home theater systems, but for a 2.1 computer speaker system, I'm really blown away by the audio quality. Vocals and mids are crisp and not drowned out by the subwoofer. The bass is just punchy enough so as to not completely annoy my neighbors.

=== OVERALL ===
If you're looking for computer speakers that are a step above the average $20 or $30 pair, then the Z407 is an excellent option. It can play audio from virtually any source over 3.5mm, USB, and Bluetooth. It is stylish, compact, and offers incredible audio quality for the price. The wireless dial has a bit of a learning curve, and I wish there were some sort of app to control the system -- but other than that, there's very little to complain about. Highly recommended!",2020-11-03T19:59:16,ryanmcv,"Phoenix, AZ",False
241582944,5,Amazing sound for the price,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me just start off with this if you’re looking for a speaker set up and don’t need something that is portable to carry around I strongly suggest you should consider the Logitech Z407. With that being said let me tell you why.

The sound coming out of this 2.1 system is amazing. For my mid-size apartment, it was able to fill my living room with a rich clear sound with the down-firing subwoofer providing some clean hitting bass. My expectations when I saw how small it was were low. Don’t let the size fool Logitech has managed to pack in some serious punch on a small package that won’t take much space. If I did a blindfold sound test without knowing what it was I would say it sounds like something that would cost an upward of $200 and up. Just an FYI I have hardwood floors so in a carpeted environment, your mileage might vary. Since it has multiple input options you can use it as a computer speaker, 2.1 stereo system to upgrade your Tv/Game Console audio, or just stream some music from your mobile device via Bluetooth or 3.5mm aux cable. Logitech has created a very versatile audio setup that instantly upgrades the sound from built-in stock speakers. Another great feature is the control that looks like a hockey puck. The control unit allows you to pair your devices via Bluetooth, switch from Bluetooth to a wired connection, and control music playback. It does require x2 AAA batteries that Logitech does provide in the box. 

Here’s a rundown of the specs:

Total Watts: RMS 40w Peak 80w
Satellites Speakers: 10w each 
Subwoofer: 20w
3.5mm input
Micro-USB input
Bluetooth 5.0

Control Puck: 
Power, volume, bass control, mute, unmute, track forward, rewind, Bluetooth pairing, source switch buttons .etc, on wireless control.


Overall:
I was highly impressed with what Logitech was able to accomplish on both ends price and quality. The sound that it reproduces rivals speakers that can cost twice as much. I would even consider the Logitech Z407 over some of the big Bluetooth speakers unless portability is a must for you.

258433122,5,Rock & Roll!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This speaker set rocks! It's a great value for the quality. Negative reviews must be mostly from nit-picking about the term ""wireless,"" the wireless controller itself, or from audiophiles with unrealistic expectations. 

Firstly, yes, it is wireless, because it has Bluetooth, and a wireless controller. The satellite speakers themselves are not wireless, they plug into the subwoofer like most computer speaker systems. 

Second, I read a lot of complaints about the wireless controller. It comes with a plastic protector with the functions printed on it. (See pic) We will just leave it there until we have them memorized, and I also have a picture now in case we forget a function, but really it's not hard to remember. The only difficult part about that is the functions being different if you use the USB input.

These are obviously inexpensive speakers. But you get 3 different ways to connect, Bluetooth, 3.5 mm audio jack, (cable included) and USB. And you get a great sounding system with wireless control. It doesn't look bad, either. 

These more than fill our bedroom with sound, they enhance everything we're listening to. We use them mainly for watching movies and TV shows, which it is excellent for. The dialog isn't drowned out by the lows.

They aren't bad at all for listening to music, either. They sound almost as good as our Sony sound bar system that cost almost 4x as much! Very pleased with this purchase, I'm glad I waited for these instead of settling for a different set.",2021-04-19T00:14:22,XJ650Maxim,Best Buy US,True

241543548,3,decent speakers,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Logitech 2.1 Bluetooth speakers is a great entry point for anyone looking to get some decent sound quality at a fair price. There are some areas it does fall short so hopefully this review will help with your buying decisions.

Let's talk about the basics here real quick. Out of the box your going to get your two speakers, main bass box, all the necessary wires and a wireless hub to control sound and playback. Let me start by saying this is a Bluetooth set up and not a wireless set up. The only thing that is wireless is the sound hub which runs off of 2 AAA batteries. Set up is very easy and can be done either via Bluetooth or through the provided 3.5 mm cable. I tested this against my ps4, android phone, and PC. Both set ups worked really good through Bluetooth except my pc. While trying to run it through the Bluetooth audio was badly distorted and would not come through crystal clear. I can't really blame Logitech for this as i don't truly know where the problem lies. What i ended up having to do was run the speakers to my PC through the 3.5 mm cable and everything worked just fine. One thing i was disappointed to see was the lack of a app to allow further customization of sound control and quality, mainly speaking of the bass speaker. The Bass speaker looks nice and with a downward facing subwoofer i was really hoping this thing would shake the ground when the bass hit. I was wrong however. Sound quality on this set up seems to focus more on clarity and vocals then it does on any other area. While playing games like COD, bass was decent around explosions and could be felt. Now don't get me wrong bass can be adjusted through the wireless hub however even at full setting it just seems like the unit is trying to hard to push it through. That's not to say the sound quality is horrible because its not. Your going to pick up on vocals and your highs very well and with very good quality, however compared to some of my other speakers that i have that are very identical to this set up, the Logitech falls short of keeping up. Through the wireless audio hub you can do some basic task like raise the volume, pause the track and skip/rewind the next track and well that's pretty much it.

Overall guys im keeping this review short because, well basically this unit is as average as it gets. There's not a whole lot of features, and there is no use of a app to control features or fine tune your audio device Sound and voice quality is very clear with decent bass however that's about where it ends. I own a lot of Logitech products and for me this would be a hard pass for two reasons. One, i like full control of my audio sounds via a provided equalizer, and two certain sound qualities are lacking. Over all this is a great set up if you are on a budget or looking for some discreet speakers. For most people this is going to be enough however im very picky when it comes to my audio and at the end of the day for me, this a basic set up at best and nothing else.",2020-10-29T16:59:15,Crasher,"littleton, Colorado",False

242858093,5,Blown Away,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It has been a while since I've purchased speakers - my last audio purchase was a sound bar about 3 years back for $250 - so I didn't know what to expect for under $100. 

I wanted a sound system that could hook up to my PC physically, and my Bluetooth Record Player in the next room over (I'm not an audiophile, I just collect Video Game soundtracks, so the BT connection was my choice for now). I thought, 'if they suck I'll just take them back and connect to my sound bar' - but I fell in love with it immediately when I get it out of the box. 

The speakers look clean (I love the ability to turn them on their sides with the included platform), and the size if perfectly compact, blending into my setup easily. Connection was easy to both my PC and my BT Record Player. I would go with this model compared to the other because the Wireless Controller is an incredible addition to the experience. It makes switching audio modes quick and simple, and offers easy access for audio controls, too. 

Last but not least - the audio quality. I know I said I'm not an audiophile, but I know when things sound good. Everyone in the apartment was blown away and in love with the warm tones and bass you can feel in your chest.

241408508,4,"All the essentials and then some, but not perfect","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For a set of desktop speakers to be truly great, they have be compact enough to fit on a desk and sound great. It may sound simple, but achieving both of those together requires a delicate balancing act and there aren't many speaker sets that can do it. This Logitech Z407 set delivers good (not great) sound in a versatile package that includes multiple connectivity options and a Bluetooth wireless remote control. The speakers fit nicely on a desk, with a subwoofer that doesn't take up too much real estate, either. Are they great? No. Are they a great deal at $80? Unquestionably. 

At this price, I can recommend them to anyone looking for good sound and great versatility.

~~Hardware and Setup~~
The Logitech Z407 comes packaged in a handsome, compact cardboard box that's small enough to fit under your arm as you carry it out of the store. The inner flap of the box provides a set of pictorial instructions that are enough to help you get started, and the components are packed smartly within. There are two satellite speakers with long cords that end in coax audio plugs, a subwoofer unit with a built-in power cord, a 1/8""-to-1/8"" audio cable about 6 feet long, the Bluetooth control puck, and a set of AAA batteries. I had the whole thing out of the box and set up on the desk in about 5 minutes. 

Following the pictorial directions, I inserted the batteries into the bottom of the control puck, connected the coax plugs from the right and left speakers and plugged the subwoofer in. Then I pressed the Bluetooth button on the bottom of the puck for a couple seconds, which allowed my PC to find and pair to it. That's it! I was able to play music through the speakers within about 7 minutes of opening the box.

The first thing I noticed about the speakers were the satellites feel really cheap in hand. Each one is basically an hollow plastic pill-shaped shell with a driver at one end. It's nice that they're able to be oriented sideways or upright, because it provides some versatility. I chose a horizontal orientation to have one speaker positioned under my second monitor. In this position, the satellite speakers are about 8"" wide, 4"" tall and 3"" deep. 

The puck also feels fairly cheap, even with the batteries inside providing a little extra weight. It has a nice feel when using the volume and tap controls, but it's definitely not built to withstand a lot of abuse. I hope my kids don't get ahold of it. 

~~Usability~~
Like I said above, I had music pumping through these speakers within 7 minutes of opening the box. Setup is pretty intuitive and the pictorial instructions are mostly good enough to fill in the blanks. The control puck is a really nice feature to have in a speaker system at the price. I love being able to control volume and previous/next track without going into any software menus or switching windows/tabs. I also love that the whole setup is virtually wireless on the desktop, as the speaker cables can be attached ""behind the scenes"" so to speak. I like the o

The one thing that I had to take a few seconds to figure out was subwoofer volume control. Pressing the puck down for two seconds switches it from master volume control to subwoofer volume control, and pressing it again lock in the sub volume and returns the control to master volume, but that took me a minute to figure out. Add to this the fact that the sub is turned way down by default, and I spent part of that minute with anemic bass wondering if I got a dud. After figuring it out, I was able to set the subwoofer where I wanted it and all was well. 

I also tested connecting the speakers to my computer using the 1/8"" audio cable and micro USB. Every method of connection works fine, and switching between them is relatively simple (buttons on the bottom of the puck). Most people will just pick one connection type and stick with it. I ended up choosing wired through the headphone jack on my laptop, because it gave the absolute best sound. 

~~Sound~~
Here's where the rubber meets the road. If your speakers don't sound good, they aren't good, no matter how many other functions/options they offer. The good news here is these are good-sounding desktop speakers. Not great, but again, for $80, these are perfectly serviceable, especially when connected to an analog output. 

Getting the speakers set up through Bluetooth was so easy that before I knew it' I'd spent a good deal of time listening to music, and finding myself wondering if these weren't actually very good-sounding at all. I should add that as Bluetooth audio goes, these are perfectly fine, and once your ears attune to the sound, it probably won't sound bad to you at all. But I found myself missing some of the headroom and stereo separation that comes with hi-fi audio. Over a Bluetooth connection, my go-to test tracks felt boxed-in and chopped off at the knees. I see these connect with Bluetooth 5.0, but I'm willing to bet they're not using one of the better audio standards like AptX HD or LC3. 

Fortunately, trying other connections really opened up the sound. Over my laptop's audio-out/headphone jack, clarity and separation was greatly improved. Not so much that you'd mistake these plastic boxes for true hi-fi speakers, but markedly. Especially with electronic music, these speakers really shine. Tracks from Bonobo's Black Sands sparkled and shone with the extra headroom, and the bass was nice and tight in the mix. The plastic revealed itself a bit on ""Come Together"" and ""Something"" from the Beatles' Abbey Road, as Paul McCartney's bass sputtered a bit inside of the cheap speaker shells. 

Somehow, on the micro USB input, the headroom remained but the mix sounded tight and compressed compared to the analog output. I'm guessing there is some extra signal processing in place for the USB output, and the differences are small but noticeable. I'd prefer to use the USB output because I can put the plug in a hub I already use and keep it away from my hands, but suppose I'll have to make do with the analog output to get the best sounding output. In this case, I would have preferred an audio cable with an angled end so I could run the cord along the outside of my laptop.

~~Final word~~
Again, as an $80 consumer-level set of desktop speakers, these are great, and leaps and bounds ahead of what $80 could buy just a few years ago. Be ready to deal with the relatively fragile plastic feel of the speakers and the puck, and be ready to experiment with inputs and outputs to get the right sound for your ears, or just accept that Bluetooth is easy and sounds okay and go with what's simplest.",2020-10-27T23:31:44,benzy,"Portland, OR",False
